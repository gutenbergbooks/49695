<blockquote>

<p><b>Motor Matt</b>, a lad who is at home with every variety of motor, and
whose never-failing nerve serves to carry him through difficulties
that would daunt any ordinary young fellow. Because
of his daring as a racer with bicycle, motor-cycle and automobile
he is known as "Mile-a-minute Matt." Motor-boats,
air ships and submarines come naturally in his line, and consequently
he lives in an atmosphere of adventure in following
up his "hobby."</p>

<p><b>Carl Pretzel</b>, a cheerful and rollicking German boy, stout of frame
as well as of heart, who is led by a fortunate accident to link his
fortunes with those of Motor Matt.</p>

<p><b>Dick Ferral</b>, a young sea dog from Canada, with all a sailor's superstitions,
but in spite of all that a royal chum, ready to stand by
the friend of his choice through thick and thin.</p>

<p><b>Don Carlos Valdez</b>, a Central American trouble-maker and adventurer,
who lays a snare for Motor Matt and thereby wrecks a
revolution and the fortunes of several of his own friends.</p>

<p><b>Captain Abner Fingal</b>, a ruffianly sea captain who assists the don
when the snare begins to tighten.</p>

<p><b>General Pitou</b>, a little swashbuckler who aimed to steal a government
and comes to grief through his two spurs and his sword.</p>

<p><b>Ysabel Sixty</b>, the daughter of the captured filibuster, James Sixty&mdash;a
loyal friend who dares much for Motor Matt.</p>

<p><b>Pedro</b>, a revolutionist who aids Ysabel.</p>

<p><b>Don Ramon Ortega</b>, the Spanish consul at Belize, British Honduras;
a gentleman of high character and ancient lineage, whose name
is a thing to conjure with.</p>

<p><b>Gaines, Clackett and Speake</b>, crew of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CARL'S SERENADE.</p>


<p>Carl Pretzel was singing. If any one with an ear for
music had heard him they might have guessed that he
was selling fish, or buying old clothes, or having an auction
with himself, but not, by the wildest flight of fancy,
could they have imagined that he had burst into song.</p>

<p>It was a rare evening in old Belize. The moon was
like a big yellow topaz pinned to a cushion of blue-black
velvet, and around it lay the stars like scattered diamonds.
Carl could not see the moon or stars very distinctly,
for it was so beastly hot that the perspiration trickled
into his eyes and half blinded him.</p>

<p>The zephyrs, laden with spicy fragrance from orange
groves and pineapple fields, breathed softly through the
tops of the palms; but Carl couldn't enjoy the zephyrs,
for a cloud of mosquitoes was pestering him and he had
to use both hands on his guitar.</p>

<p>The house before which Carl was playing and singing
was a whitewashed bungalow. Between the bungalow
and the street ran a high brick wall. The iron gate leading
into the yard was locked, and Carl had climbed the
wall, skinning his shins and tearing his clothes. But he
didn't mind that. He had read somewhere that when a
gay young Spanish blade admires a young Spanish lady,
he grabs a guitar and goes and sings to her. Carl wasn't
going to let any Spaniard back him off the boards, so he
grabbed a guitar and stole like a thief into that Belize
yard to serenade Ysabel Sixty.</p>

<p>Carl was not very well acquainted with the lay of the
land in Belize. By an error of judgment he had got into
the wrong yard, and by another conspiracy of circumstances
he began pouring out his enraptured soul under
the window of a room in which Captain Reginald Charles
Arthur Pierce-Plympton, of the local constabulary, was
trying to sleep. Miss Sixty was staying with relatives a
block farther on, around the corner of the next street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Utterly unaware of his mistake, Carl fought the discomforts
of his situation and heroically kept to his labor
of love. Ysabel Sixty was a fine girl, and Carl had a
warm spot in his heart for her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Der rose iss ret,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Der fiolet's plue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oof I lofe me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As you lofe you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No knife can cut us togedder!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This touching bit of sentiment was merely the overture.
Carl knew how to play the guitar, for he had once been a
member of a knockabout musical team, and he could get
music out of anything from a set of sleigh bells to a
steam calliope. If he had been able to use his voice as
well as he used the guitar, Captain Reginald Charles
Arthur Pierce-Plympton would probably have slept on
or even have been lulled into deeper slumber; but there
were dull spots in Carl's voice where there should have
been sharps, and high places where there should have
been flats, and whoops, grunts and falling inflections
where there should have been trills, grace notes and a
soft petal generally.</p>

<p>Captain Reginald Charles Arthur Pierce-Plympton
stirred uneasily, sat up suddenly in his bed and knocked
his high forehead against the iron bar that supported a
canopy of mosquito netting. As he rubbed his temples
and said things to himself, he listened with growing
anger.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Du hast diamanten und perlen</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Chimineddy, vat a hotness!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hast alles was menschen begehren</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whoosh! Der muskedoodles vas vorse as der heat!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Du hast ja die schönsten augen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mein liebchen was willst du noch mehr?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Captain Reginald Charles Arthur Pierce-Plympton
blinked his eyes and began forming a plan of campaign.
There was a pitcher of water on a table in his room, a
bulldog in the yard, and a valiant assistant in the form
of Hadji Sing, his Hindoo servant. Getting softly out of
bed, the captain prepared for his attack on the enemy.</p>

<p>When Carl climbed over the wall he had dropped into
the yard at the foot of a lemon tree. He had jarred the
tree and a half-ripe lemon had dropped on him. This
omen should have sent him away and postponed the
serenade, but it did not.</p>

<p>After slapping at the mosquitoes and drawing his sleeve
across his eyes, Carl went on picking the guitar.</p>

<p>"Now for der nexdt spasm," he murmured. "I vill put
der German vorts indo English for der leedle gal,
yah, so.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You haf plendy oof tiamonts und bearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Haf all vat a laty couldt vant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You haf likevise der peautiful eye-es,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My tarling vat more&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Just then the water descended. It was well aimed and
Carl caught the whole of it. Probably there was no more
than a couple of gallons, but Carl, for the moment, was
under the impression that it was a tidal wave.</p>

<p>His song died out in a wheezy gurgle and, for a moment,
he was stunned. Then, suddenly, he realized that
he had been insulted. Ysabel Sixty, the beautiful maiden
who had captured his young fancy, had deliberately
thrown&mdash;&mdash; But his thoughts were interrupted by a
voice from the window&mdash;a voice that certainly was not
Miss Sixty's.</p>

<p>"Bah Jove! I'll throw the pitcher at you, fellow, if
you don't clear out!"</p>

<p>Carl was dazed. He knew, then, that he had made a
mistake. While he stood there, half drowned and trying
to find his voice, the bark of an approaching dog came
from the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and it
flashed over Carl on the instant that if he wanted to save
himself he would have to run. Without standing on the
order of his going, he whirled and fled toward the fence.
The dog was close and rapidly drawing closer. Behind
the dog came a white-turbaned figure that was urging
the brute onward with strange language.</p>

<p>The front fence looked altogether too high for Carl,
and he turned and made for a wall at the side of the
yard. Just as he gained the foot of the barrier the dog
was snapping at his heels.</p>

<p>"Dere!" he whooped, turning and smashing the guitar
over the dog's head, "how you like dot, hey?"</p>

<p>The dog was rebuffed, but not discouraged. Carl had
gained a few valuable seconds, and he grabbed at a vine
that covered the wall and climbed frantically upward. He
heard a growl below him as he ascended, and felt a shock
as the savage teeth closed in his trousers. The dog was
heavy, his jaws were as strong as a steel trap, and as
Carl hung wildly to the vine he knew that something
would have to give way or else that he would be captured.
It was with a feeling of joy, therefore, that he
heard a tearing sound and experienced a sudden relief
from his enforced burden. The next moment he was
over the wall and floundering about in a thorny rose-bush
covered with beautiful blossoms. But the beautiful
blossoms did not make so deep an impression on Carl as
did the thorns.</p>

<p>As he rolled out of the bushes his language was intense
and earnest; and when he got up in a cleared stretch
of ground he felt a sudden coolness below the waist-line
that informed him fully of his predicament. He had left
an important part of his apparel in the next yard.</p>

<p>"Vat a luck id iss!" he muttered. "I porrowed dot
kiddar from der vaider py der hodel, und id vas gone
to smash. Meppy I vill haf to pay as mooch as fife tollars
for dot. Und den dere vill be anodder fife tollars for
some more pands. Fife und fife iss den. Oof I make
some more serenadings I vill be busted. Vat a laff Matt
und Tick vill gif me! Py shinks, I can't go pack py der<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
hodel like dis! Vat iss to be dit? Mit some clot', und
some neetles und t'read, I could make some patches.
Vere vill I ged dem?"</p>

<p>He paused to shake his fist in the direction of the
yard he had just left. All was silent on the other side,
and the man and the dog, Carl reasoned, must have gone
back where they belonged.</p>

<p>A survey of the situation in the moonlight showed
Carl another bungalow. It was not so pretentious as the
house in the next inclosure, but its walls were as brightly
whitewashed and the building stood out clearly against its
background of shrubbery. The windows of the house
were dark. But this was to be expected, as the hour was
past midnight. The noise which Carl had made had not
seemed to disturb the inmates.</p>

<p>"Oof I hat der nerf," thought Carl, "I vould go dere
und ask der beople for somet'ing to fix meinseluf oop,
but meppy I vouldt get soaked mit some more vater, und
meppy dere iss anodder tog. No, py shinks, I vill go pack
py der hodel und led Matt und Tick laff as mooch as dey
vill."</p>

<p>But luck was still against Carl; or perhaps, in the inscrutable
way whereby fate occasionally works in order
to secure the greatest good for the greatest number, he
was merely encountering obstacles in order to gain
knowledge of a plot that had been leveled against Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>Carl found a tall iron gate, set into the high front wall
as snugly as a door in its casing. But the gate was
locked. More than that, the wall could not be scaled, for
there were no vines or near-by trees to offer a lift upward.</p>

<p>Carefully he made his way around all four sides of the
inclosure, only to be balked at every point. Then he
hunted for a ladder, a box, or some other movable thing
on which he could stand while getting over the wall, but
his search was fruitless.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," he muttered, again moving toward the
house, "I vill haf to shpeak mit somepody in der blace
und dry und ged oudt. I don'd vant to shday here undil
morning."</p>

<p>At the rear of the house he rapped. Although he
pounded heavily, no one answered his summons. Alarmed
by the thought that there was no one at home, he moved
around to the front door and rapped again, still without
effect. Next he tried the door. To his amazement he
found it unlocked.</p>

<p>When the door swung open a blank darkness yawned
beyond it.</p>

<p>"Hello, somepody!" Carl called, thrusting his head inside.
"I don'd vas a t'ief, or anyt'ing like dot, aber I vas
in drouple. Hello! Come und led me oudt oof der
yardt, blease, oof you vill be so kindt."</p>

<p>His voice echoed rumblingly through the interior of
the house, but won no response. Hesitatingly, Carl
stepped across the threshold. He had matches in his
pocket, and they had come through the recent deluge unharmed.
With fingers none too steady he scratched one,
held the flickering glow above him and peered around.</p>

<p>The next moment his startled eyes encountered an object
on the floor that caused him to drop the match from
his nerveless fingers and fall back gaspingly against
the wall.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DON RAMON ORTEGA.</p>


<p>The object which had so startled the Dutch boy was
the figure of a middle-aged man, sprawled at full length
on the floor matting. His hands were secured behind him
and his feet were bound at the ankles with twisted
towels. Over the lower part of his face another towel
had been tied, thus effectually preventing outcry.</p>

<p>Carl's own troubles faded into the background. As he
slowly got the whip hand of himself, he struck another
match and stepped to the man's side. The man gurgled
incoherently behind the gag and his dark eyes pleaded
for immediate release.</p>

<p>"Dere iss some dricky pitzness here, you bed you!"
exclaimed Carl. "Don'd be schared oof me," he added
to the man, "I vas a friendt, und I vill helup you. Schust
vait a leedle undil I ged some pedder lighdt as vat I
haf."</p>

<p>There was an oil lamp on a table, and Carl stepped to
it and applied a match to the wick. In the glow that presently
flooded the room, the Dutch boy returned to the
man, knelt down beside him and removed the towels.</p>

<p>"<i>Ay de mi!</i>" stuttered the man, attempting to rise and
falling helplessly back again.</p>

<p>"Vas you hurt some blace?" asked Carl solicitously.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" echoed the man, speaking good English, although
with a very perceptible foreign accent. "Not at
all, señor; only my limbs&mdash;they are so cramped from confinement
that I cannot stand. Soon they will be all right.
But who are you?" and suspicion suddenly flamed in the
dark eyes. "How does it happen that you know of my
trouble and have come here? Are you a confederate of
the rascally Don Carlos?"</p>

<p>"Ton Garlos?" repeated Carl. "I don'd know dot feller
from Atam. I vas a shdranger in dis blace, und all I
know iss der Amerigan consul, Misder Hays Chordan
und Toctor Armsdrong, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are American?" interrupted the other eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yah, so; Amerigan mit a Dutch accent."</p>

<p>"How do you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"Id vas a plunder, dot's all," answered Carl. "A pulltog
chaced me und pooty near caught me, doo. I got
ofer der vall from der odder site und couldn't get pack
some more. Vat a high vall iss aboudt der blace! Und
so smoot' und shlippery as I can't dell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"What were you doing in the other yard?"</p>

<p>Carl didn't want to mention that part of it, but it
seemed necessary in order to convince the man of his
harmless intentions.</p>

<p>"Vell," he answered diffidently, "I vent der mit meinseluf
to serenate a yoong laty py der name oof Miss
Sixdy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Ysabel Sixty?" the other again interrupted, even
more eagerly than he had done before.</p>

<p>"Yah, so!" beamed Carl. "You know der laty?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. But she does not live in the next house,
señor. An English captain lives there&mdash;an officer in
charge of the constabulary. Miss Sixty is staying with
friends a block farther down the street, and around the
corner."</p>

<p>"Vell, I t'ought I hat made some misdakes," said Carl,
vastly relieved. "A parrel oof vater vas tropped on me,
und I vas run off mit a pulltog, und&mdash;und&mdash;&mdash; Blease,
haf you some clot' patches und some neetles und t'read?
I vouldt like to be respectaple vonce more."</p>

<p>The man got to his feet slowly and then, his eyes
gleaming ominously, caught Carl's arm in both hands.</p>

<p>"Let us not think so much of ourselves now, señor," he
said thickly, "but of others!"</p>

<p>"Vat aboudt id?" inquired Carl, wondering whether
the released gentleman was crazy or excited.</p>

<p>"I am Don Ramon Ortega," answered the man.</p>

<p>This was another surprise. Carl had heard of Don
Ramon Ortega. He was the Spanish consul in Belize, a
man of high lineage and of much importance.</p>

<p>"How keveer dot I shouldt come py your house like
vat I dit, Ton Ramon!" muttered Carl. "I hope," he
added, in a tremor, "dot der laties von't come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are none here but ourselves," cut in the don.
"My family and all the servants have gone to Mexico.
I myself was intending to go in the morning, but now I
shall not leave Belize until I make that scoundrelly Don
Carlos Valdez answer for this rascally work he has
done!"</p>

<p>"Ton Carlos Valdez?" repeated Carl. "I don'd know
der feller. Vat has he dit?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," answered the don. "Come, let us
sit down for a moment. My limbs are not strong yet,
and there is much to be done."</p>

<p>Carl, excited and curious, dropped into a chair. The
don, after giving a cautious look outside, closed the door
and returned to Carl. Drawing a chair close, he seated
himself.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said he, "do you know of a submarine boat
in the harbor called the <i>Grampus</i>? You are American,
and the boat is owned by Captain Nemo, Jr., an American.
You should know of her."</p>

<p>"Vell, py chiminy Grismus," boomed Carl, "you bed
you! Vy, ton, I vas vone oof der crew oof der
<i>Grampus</i>! I come mit her ven she arrifed, und I vas mit
her ven she got der American consul avay from der
repels in der rifer Izaral. Vy, Modor Matt, who vas
boss oof der poat ven she dit dot, iss my friendt, my
bard! Und so iss Tick Ferral! Know der <i>Grampus</i>!
Py chincher, I know her insite und oudt, oop und down
und sitevays. My name is Pretzel, Carl Pretzel."</p>

<p>Don Ramon Ortega was astounded, but happily so.
Reaching out his hand, he clasped Carl's convulsively.</p>

<p>"Ah, what good fortune!" he murmured, "what amazing
luck! Destiny is at work in all this. Fate guided you
to me to-night, <i>amigo mio</i>!"</p>

<p>"A pulltog hat more to do mit it as fate," answered
Carl simply.</p>

<p>"Listen!" proceeded the don hurriedly. "I was here
alone in the early evening. Some one rang the bell at the
gate. I went out and admitted"&mdash;anger throbbed in the
Spaniard's voice&mdash;"Don Carlos Valdez! He is, what you
Americans call, a trouble maker. I call him a pestilence,
an evil spectre who stalks through the devoted countries
and helps revolutionists overthrow established governments.
I am Spanish, but I love law and order! I hate
violence and bloodshed! I am for peace! But Don
Carlos is always for war, and more war, for in that he
finds unholy profit. Well, it was he who called on me
to-night. He declared that he wanted a passport, for he
was going abroad. I told him to go to my secretary, at
the legation. He said he had been there, but that the
secretary was not in. I could not refuse him the passport
if his intentions were peaceable and he paid the fee,
so he came back into the house with me. As I seated
myself and leaned over the table, the demon struck me
from behind. I fell unconscious. When I recovered, I
was bound as you saw me, and I have laid so for hours.
But Don Carlos had not left when I regained consciousness.
He and I have long been at swords' points, and he
taunted me with the base plans he intended to carry out."</p>

<p>Don Ramon writhed in his chair in a spasm of fierce
anger.</p>

<p>"Vat it vas he iss going to do?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"He has designs on the submarine!" proceeded the
don. "He thinks the boat would be valuable to the revolutionists
to the south of us. They are threatening Port
Livingston, at the mouth of the Izaral, and are seeking
to secure the fort there. The lawful authorities of the
state will send ships of war to defeat the revolutionists,
and Don Carlos wants the submarine to destroy the war
vessels."</p>

<p>"Himmelblitzen!" gasped Carl. "Aber," he added
soothingly, "don'd you be vorked oop, ton. Der schemer
von't ged der supmarine. Captain Nemo, Jr., iss sick,
aber Modor Matt iss on der chob, und you bed you he
von't let Don Carlos haf der <i>Grampus</i> to helup oudt der
repels."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable</i>, no! Motor Matt will not hire the boat to the
rascally Don Carlos, but he is a serpent for craft. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
intends to get the boat away from Belize by a ruse&mdash;<i>and
will use my name</i>, my honorable name, to help him prosecute
his villainous plot! Think of that, <i>amigo</i>!"</p>

<p>"How vill he do dot, ton?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but such is his miserable intention;
he flaunted it in my face as I lay on the floor at his feet,
helpless to move or to speak. We must prevent him from
carrying out his contemptible designs. I have told you
so much, because it was necessary that you should understand.
Come! Let us go at once to Motor Matt! Let
us warn him, and put him on his guard."</p>

<p>"Dot's me, ton!" agreed Carl heartily, "aber haf you
a pair oof drousers vat I couldt vear?"</p>

<p>"That is a small matter, Señor Pretzel," demurred the
don on his way to the door, "and we have other and
larger matters to claim our instant attention."</p>

<p>"Some more drousers iss kevite imbortant mit me,"
insisted Carl. "Id von't dake more as a minude, ton."</p>

<p>Rather than waste time arguing, Don Ramon flung
off into a neighboring room. He returned presently with
a pair of white duck trousers, and Carl climbed into them.
They were too long and too narrow, but the Dutch boy
contrived to make them serve.</p>

<p>"Now, ton," said Carl, "ged der key by der front gate
und lead der vay."</p>

<p>The don took a key from the drawer of the table.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>amigo</i>," said he, hurrying from the door.</p>

<p>"Id's a funny pizness," remarked Carl, following, "dot
dis Carlos feller vouldt leaf der door oben und lock der
gate."</p>

<p>"The gate locks itself when it is closed," explained the
don.</p>

<p>"I don'd t'ink, anyvay, dere iss mooch use being in
some takings aboudt der poat," proceeded Carl, as the
don unlocked the gate. "Dot Carlos feller vill haf his
hants full pulling der vool ofer Modor Matt's eyes."</p>

<p>"You do not know Carlos as well as I," answered Don
Ramon ominously. "He is plausible, he has many tricks,
and then he is impersonating <i>me</i>! Motor Matt must
know me by name, although I have not the pleasure of
his personal acquaintance. I am fearing the worst, ah,
yes, the worst!"</p>

<p>The gate clanged shut behind them and the don and
Carl raced for the International Hotel. Matt and Dick
stayed at the hotel while they were ashore. Carl had
not seen either of his chums at supper, and he had not
spent much time looking for them. The serenade was
uppermost in Carl's mind, and he was afraid Matt or
Dick might propose something that would interfere with
his plans.</p>

<p>In the hotel office they learned that Matt and Dick
had gone out to the submarine early in the evening to
arrange some stores that had been taken aboard. They
had not come back, so the inference was that they were
staying the night on the craft.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for the don and Carl to do but
to hurry on to the wharf. There, at the landing from
which sailboats usually carried the <i>Grampus'</i> crew to the
anchorage, half a mile out in the bay, they met a policeman.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for, Don Ramon?" inquired the
officer respectfully, touching the don on the shoulder as
he and Carl were gazing off across the surface of the bay.</p>

<p>"For the riding lights of the submarine boat, <i>amigo</i>,"
answered the don.</p>

<p>"You won't see them, sir. The submarine left the
harbor four hours ago, bound south."</p>

<p>"<i>Carramba!</i>" cried the don. "We are too late! Tell
me, did she have any passengers?"</p>

<p>"Motor Matt and the boat's usual crew were aboard
anyhow, I saw Motor Matt and his friend, Ferral, going
out."</p>

<p>"Did any one else go out to the boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Don Carlos Valdez and four or five negroes.
They&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The don whirled away and caught Carl's arm.</p>

<p>"Too late!" he whispered hoarsely. "But perhaps
there is still something we can do. Come! We will call
on the American consul; we will tell him what we fear!"</p>

<p>Carl was in a daze. That serenade of his, which had
proved a farce, seemed to be leading up to something
tragic.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SHADOW OF TREACHERY.</p>


<p>"What's our next billet going to be, matey?" inquired
Dick Ferral, sprawling out comfortably on top of the long
locker in the periscope room.</p>

<p>Matt was just coming down the ladder after putting
the riding lights in position.</p>

<p>"Wish I knew, Dick," he answered, switching on the
incandescent in the periscope room and dropping down
on a low stool.</p>

<p>"I had a dream last night," and Dick gave a short
laugh as he spoke. "I was doing as sound a caulk as
ever I did in my life when that dream jumped in on me,
and it was so blooming realistic that it brought me up in
my bed with a yell."</p>

<p>"You must have been eating <i>chili con carne</i>, or some of
the other hot stuff they have down here, before you went
to bed. The peppery grub they give you in Belize would
make a wooden Indian have the nightmare! But what
was it, old chap? You've got me interested."</p>

<p>"It was about Fingal."</p>

<p>"Fingal?"</p>

<p>"Aye, matey, Captain Abner Fingal of the schooner
<i>North Star</i>, the hooting, tooting old revolutionist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
brother of Captain Jim Sixty, who's now, I hope and believe,
doing time in a United States' federal prison."</p>

<p>"Fingal," observed Motor Matt, "is a tough old proposition
to dream about."</p>

<p>"I won't forget in a hurry how he crossed our hawse,
down there on the River Izaral, or how you came up
under our gasoline launch with the good old <i>Grampus</i>,
tipped over the launch, and released the prisoners and
pulled them out of the drink. Fingal and one of the rebel
soldiers got away from us by the skin of their teeth.
Do you remember how, when Fingal reached the bank,
he got up on his knees and shook his fist after us?"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> See No. 16 of the <span class="smcap">Motor Stories</span>, "Motor Matt's Quest; or,
Three Chums in Strange Waters."</p></div>

<p>"I'll not forget that in a hurry," said Matt. "If Fingal
could have had us in his hands then we'd have experienced
a little more trouble than we could have taken care
of. But what's the dream?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I was adrift in a big forest, with
Fingal and a lot of revolutionists hustling after me, full
and by and forty knots, all with machetes. General
Pitou, the French leader of the revolutionists, was with
Fingal, and the whole pack of them had machetes in each
hand and another between their teeth. Finally they caught
me, and I was hacked in pieces&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mighty pleasant, that!" grinned Matt.</p>

<p>"They hung my head up in a tree," proceeded Dick
grewsomely, "and when I saw the rest of me scattered
over the ground underneath, my nerves went to pieces
and I fetched a yell that ought to have raised the roof.
Strike me lucky, but I was in a sweat! We're not done
with Abner Fingal, mate. He'll foul our course before
we're many days older."</p>

<p>"I don't take any stock in dreams. They always come
from a fellow's stomach&mdash;something he eats that disagrees
with him. As for Fingal, you can bet he'll not come to
Belize. He'd like to play even with us, all right, but he
has got sense enough not to run his head into a noose."</p>

<p>Speake, Gaines and Clackett were stowing supplies in
another part of the boat. From time to time, as the boys
talked, muffled thumps and a sound of distant voices
came to them. Cassidy, the mate, was ashore, taking
care of the sick captain.</p>

<p>"What's the latest news from Nemo, Jr.?" queried
Dick. "The last I heard was this morning. The captain
wasn't so well then, Doctor Armstrong told me."</p>

<p>"I saw Cassidy just before we started for the landing
to come out to the submarine," said Matt. "He said the
doctor was sure the captain would pull through, but that
he would need careful nursing, and not be bothered with
business of any kind."</p>

<p>"Cassidy will give him the right kind of nursing! I
never saw a shellback that was so handy in the sick bay,
nor who tried to do more. Nemo, Jr., ought to forgive
Cassidy for his treachery, down there on the Izaral."</p>

<p>"The captain will do that, I'm sure. Cassidy is mighty
sorry he allowed his temper to run away with him. Fingal
was responsible for what Cassidy did."</p>

<p>"Fingal and the grog," commented Dick. "A few tots
of rum will make pirates and beach combers out of a lot
of honest men. But why are you getting all these supplies
aboard, mate? We're loaded to the marks with
provisions, gasoline, oil, and everything else."</p>

<p>"You know, don't you," returned Dick, "that Captain
Nemo, Jr., is planning to sell the <i>Grampus</i> to the United
States government?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye. The captain has had that bee in his bonnet
for a long time."</p>

<p>"When we went down the coast and rescued the American
consul from the revolutionists, it was at the instigation
of the United States authorities. Of course, they
were anxious to have the consul rescued, but they were
equally anxious to see what the <i>Grampus</i> could do."</p>

<p>"Well, we showed 'em!" said Dick proudly. "The little
old flugee, and every one aboard, did themselves proud!
What else does your government want, matey?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as the government wants anything else,
but I have thought it best to keep the <i>Grampus</i> in trim
for any demand that should be made on her. Any time,
now, I'm expecting to see the U. S. cruiser <i>Seminole</i>
stick her nose in the bay with orders for the <i>Grampus</i> to
get under way for the Potomac, bound for Washington.
If the order comes, it must find us in the pink of condition."</p>

<p>"Suppose the order comes before the captain gets
well?"</p>

<p>"Then the chances are he'll ask us to carry out the
order for him. We're in pretty good shape to do that,
even without the assistance of Cassidy. Our little crew
of six can manage the craft, all right. Carl has been taking
lessons from Clackett and can look after the tank
room almost as well as Clackett himself; and you have
learned to run the motor in a way that has made a hit
with Gaines."</p>

<p>"We'll do, matey," said Dick, with a long breath of
satisfaction. "With you as skipper, I wouldn't be afraid
to ride in the <i>Grampus</i> from here to the North Pole.
Speaking of Carl, though, what's become of the lubber?
He cut his cables mighty sudden, seems to me."</p>

<p>"He borrowed a guitar from a fellow in the hotel,"
laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"A guitar? What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if he had gone off to serenade
somebody."</p>

<p>Dick rolled over on his back and kicked the locker with
his heels.</p>

<p>"Oh, my eye!" he sputtered. "It's Ysabel Sixty! Carl's
been gone in that quarter for some time." Suddenly
Dick hoisted up on his elbow and peered at his chum.
"What do you say, mate? Let's go ashore and slant away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
for the place where Ysabel is staying. We can look over
the fence and jolly our Dutch messmate just as he gets
tuned up. How about a bit of a lark?"</p>

<p>"I'll go you!" chuckled Matt, "but there's no use starting
for two or three hours yet. Midnight is the witching
hour."</p>

<p>"Carl's showing good taste, anyhow," continued Dick.
"Ysabel Sixty is a fine girl. Now that her father, Jim
Sixty, is put where he can't interfere with her, she's going
to be happier than she ever was before. But Carl is off
soundings. The lass hasn't an eye for him, matey, but
for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, splash!" grunted Matt.</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;flog the cat. But it's a fact, all the
same. The lass has taken a fancy to you, Matt, and you
wouldn't turn your head to look at the handsomest girl
that ever walked. Gasoline motors are your hobby. An
explosive engine will be your best girl till the end of the
chapter."</p>

<p>Matt enjoyed this. Dick had a way, now and then, of
giving a subject a humorous turn that was highly diverting.
Just as Matt was on the point of giving some jesting
reply, a voice came to them from without.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, de <i>Grampus</i>! Tumble out an' pass us a line!"</p>

<p>Both boys gained their feet on the instant.</p>

<p>"That's Sambo with his sailboat!" exclaimed Dick.
"He's bringing visitors. Nice time, this, to receive callers
from Belize."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's Carl coming back," answered Matt, halfway
up the iron ladder toward the conning-tower hatch.</p>

<p>"If it is," went on Dick, laying hold of the ladder, "then
our fun for to-night is knocked in the head."</p>

<p>As soon as Matt got his head out of the hatch he saw
a small sailboat hove to alongside the submarine. There
were several men in her, and two were standing forward
and aft to catch the ropes they were expecting to be
thrown. Because of the evening dusk it was impossible
to distinguish those in the boat, but it was plain that the
craft was the one which the crew of the <i>Grampus</i> used
for going ashore.</p>

<p>A dark shadow was thrown by the boat against the
lighter background of water&mdash;a hovering, ominous shadow
of treachery&mdash;all the more ominous because neither
of the chums were suspecting underhand work there in
those peaceable waters off the British town of Belize.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DON CARLOS LAYS HIS SNARE.</p>


<p>"Ahoy, yourself!" shouted Matt. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"Dar's a gentman here, Marse Cap'n, dat wants tuh
come on bo'd," answered the voice of Sambo.</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>Here another form pushed forward and another voice
took up the conversation.</p>

<p>"Are you Motor Matt?" asked the voice.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have charge of the submarine while Captain
Nemo, Jr., is sick?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you're the person I wish to talk with. I am Don
Ramon Ortega."</p>

<p>Matt was deeply impressed by the name. Everybody
in Belize had a good word to say for Don Ramon Ortega,
the Spanish consul. He was a chivalrous gentleman of
the old school, a friend of the United States when many
other of his countrymen cherished a grudge against the
country, and a philanthropic and kindly man in all his
dealings.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to have you come aboard, Don
Ortega," called Matt respectfully, "but it is against our
rules to allow more than one stranger aboard the <i>Grampus</i>
at any one time."</p>

<p>"Then I will come alone."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick got out of the tower and each hurled
a rope to those forward and aft on the sailboat. After
the two boats had been hauled as close together as possible,
a plank was shoved over the side of the sailboat and
left with its outer end resting on the rounded deck of the
submarine. Don Ramon turned and handed something
to Sambo.</p>

<p>"Haul off," said he, "and wait until you receive a signal
from me. If you don't receive a signal, put back to the
landing."</p>

<p>"All right, boss."</p>

<p>Matt was a little surprised at this order, but presumed
that he would soon be told why it had been given. Reaching
out, he caught the don's hand and helped him off the
end of the plank.</p>

<p>"I must speak with you immediately," said the don.
"Can we go somewhere for a little private talk?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Matt, his wonder continuing
to grow.</p>

<p>The don carried a canvas bag whose contents jingled
musically with every movement. While Matt and Dick
escorted their caller below, those on the sailboat hauled
in the plank and stood off toward the shore.</p>

<p>Speake, Gaines and Clackett were still busy stowing the
supplies and getting the <i>Grampus</i> shipshape below decks.
The two boys and their guest made themselves comfortable
in the periscope room.</p>

<p>Don Ramon, as Matt looked at him now for the first
time, had the appearance of a courtly gentleman. He
was swarthy, well dressed, and his dark eyes, as they
stared about him curiously, looked like points of polished
jet.</p>

<p>The don took a card case from his pocket and extracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a square of pasteboard bearing the coat of arms of his
native country, his name and the information that he was
Spanish consul at Belize. He handed the card to Matt,
and Matt, in turn, passed it along to Dick.</p>

<p>"We have heard a good deal about you, don," remarked
Matt, "but this is the first time we have ever met."</p>

<p>"And I have heard much about you," was the answer,
in most gracious tones; "very much to your credit. The
recent performance of the <i>Grampus</i> made a deep impression
upon me, and that is why I am here to-night. If
you wish, you can render a great service to the cause
of right and justice; possibly it hangs upon you to terminate
the uprising in the unhappy little republic that lies
to the south."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick were all interest on the moment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, don?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Pitou and his rebels have captured Port Livingston
and the fort on the headland across the river from the
town. Every inch of the coast is guarded. The loyal
army is marching from the Pacific side of the republic&mdash;very
few in numbers and poorly armed. Pitou, the great
rogue, has laid a trap for the loyalists. Unless General
Mendez, in charge of the loyal troops, is communicated
with to-morrow morning, there will be fighting and bloodshed,
and perhaps the insurrectionists will win."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick were following the don closely, wondering
what he was driving at.</p>

<p>"Of course," the don resumed, after a brief silence, "as
Spanish consul, I am not warranted in mixing in the imbroglio.
Whatever I do, I do in a private capacity, and
merely as a preserver of peace. However, it is well
known that the insurrection, headed by this soldier of fortune,
Pitou, is merely for the sake of gain. If successful,
Pitou and Fingal would get a grip on the throat of the
little republic, and lawlessness would reign. You know
something about Pitou and Fingal and their base methods
and designs. Therefore, I come to you."</p>

<p>"Why do you come to me, don?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, with the submarine you could pass the mouth of
the Izaral under water and unseen by the rebels; you
could continue up the Izaral, still below the surface, to
the place where the Purgatoire enters the stream. From
that point I could communicate with General Mendez
and warn him of the trap that has been laid by Pitou.
The general could save his army&mdash;and the fate of the
republic hangs on General Mendez. Will you do this?
Will you assist Don Ramon Ortega in such a humanitarian
work?"</p>

<p>Matt was dazed by the proposition.</p>

<p>"You," pursued the don passionately, "come from a
great and rich country, where there is always peace. Then
have you got it in your heart to withhold a helping hand
from a smaller and war-harried little country whose fate
may hang upon your decision? See!"</p>

<p>The don pulled a stool in front of him, untied the canvas
sack and spilled a heap of golden sovereigns out of it.</p>

<p>"Here are fifty pieces of gold, Motor Matt," went on
the don, "and, if we are successful in passing the revolutionists
and getting word to General Mendez, you shall
have <i>one thousand more</i>. Will you do this for me, Don
Ramon Ortega? Will you do it for humanity? I do not
appeal to your wish for gain&mdash;you are above such sordid
things&mdash;but I ask you in the name of right and justice!
Lives, human lives, depend on you! The fate of a republic
depends on you! As for the risk to you and the
submarine&mdash;bah!" The don shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
"Am I not going with you? Would I
endanger my own life?"</p>

<p>The don paused anxiously for reply. Dick peered at
his friend reflectively. Speake, Clackett and Gaines, having
finished their work below, had come to the periscope
room and were standing in one of the bulkhead doors.
They had heard the don's proposition, and the gold was
sparkling its lure in their greedy eyes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, don," said Matt, with a note of deep regret
in his voice, "but I have not the authority to let you have
the <i>Grampus</i> for any such work."</p>

<p>"You are the captain?"</p>

<p>"I am in charge of the boat while her captain is sick.
You should take your proposition to Captain Nemo, Jr."</p>

<p>"I went to see him, but the doctor refused to let me in.
The doctor said the captain was unable to talk with anybody.
So I came to you."</p>

<p>"I haven't the authority, don," repeated Matt firmly.
"Wait until the captain is able to talk business. I can't
risk the boat."</p>

<p>"There is no risk!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I have no more right to take this
boat out of the harbor, don, than you have."</p>

<p>The don passed his dejected glance from Matt to Dick,
and then toward the three faces in the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>Gaines pushed forward.</p>

<p>"Matt," said he, "I think you might stretch a point.
Them golden sovs look mighty fine to me. There's two
hundred an' fifty dollars' worth there, and we're promised
five thousand dollars' worth more. Cap'n Nemo, Jr., if
he was able, would tell us to go ahead an' capture the
prize money. I move we hook up with the don."</p>

<p>"Might jest as well turn a few honest dollars, Matt,"
put in Speake, "as to be layin' idle here, off Belize."</p>

<p>"My idee, exactly," said Clackett. "I know the cap'n
would do it if he was able to hear the don's proposition."</p>

<p>"Why not, matey?" said Dick, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Matt shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>"I'd go in a minute if I had the right to do so," said
he, "but I haven't. Suppose the <i>Seminole</i> should put into
the harbor to-night with orders for the <i>Grampus</i>? You
know what it would mean, Dick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick was silent, but not convinced. The men were disappointed,
and watched the don as he shoved the gold
coins back into the bag.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, too," said he, tying up the bag, "and I feel,
Motor Matt, that you are letting a lot of useless red tape
interfere with your duties to humanity."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, don, I merely understand my duty better than
you do," answered Matt, respectfully but firmly. "I
haven't any love for Pitou, or Fingal, or the rascally revolutionists,
and I promise you this, that I will see Captain
Nemo, Jr., personally in the morning, and, if the doctor
will let me, will put your proposition before him. If he
agrees, we will start for the south at once."</p>

<p>"That will be too late," said the don, getting up and
taking his bag of sovereigns. "I will bid you good evening,
hail my boat and go ashore," he added stiffly.</p>

<p>With chilly dignity he climbed the conning-tower ladder
and hailed the sailboat. Matt, Dick and the others
saw him safely aboard and the boat headed shoreward,
then again went below.</p>

<p>"I'm tired," announced Matt, cutting short a further
discussion of the don and his proposition, "and I'm going
to bed. You and Clackett, Gaines, will have the anchor
watch till midnight. After that, call Dick and me."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Gaines.</p>

<p>Dick accompanied Matt to a room abaft the periscope
chamber, in which a couple of cots had been set up, and
silently the two chums turned in. Nothing more was said
about going ashore to interrupt Carl's serenade. Matt
knew that Dick thought he should have accepted the don's
proposition, and yet, feeling that he was in the right, did
not care to discuss the matter. With a hearty good night
to Dick, he turned over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>How long Matt slept he did not know, but he was awakened
by the throb of a motor and started bolt upright in
his bed.</p>

<p>The <i>Grampus</i> was moving! The roll of the craft proved
that she was on the surface and under way. All was dark
in the little steel room, and Matt got up and groped for
the switch that turned on the incandescent light. A moment
later there was a dazzling glow, and Matt looked at
the bulkhead doors. They had been open when he and
Dick turned in, and now they were closed!</p>

<p>He started for the door leading to the periscope room.
Just as he laid his hand on it, Dick roused up.</p>

<p>"What's the blooming go, mate?" queried Dick, rubbing
his eyes. "We seem to be on the move."</p>

<p>"We are," answered Matt grimly.</p>

<p>"Who's in charge, and where are we going?"</p>

<p>"Give it up! All I know is that we're locked in."</p>

<p>Then he began shaking the steel door and kicking
against it.</p>

<p>"Gaines!" he yelled.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A MUTINY.</p>


<p>"What is it, Matt?" asked the muffled voice of Gaines
from the other side of the closed door.</p>

<p>"Let me out of here!" ordered Matt.</p>

<p>"Can't do it just yet, Matt," answered Gaines apologetically.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that we're going to help out General Mendez
with that warning of the don's. You wouldn't take the
responsibility, but Speake and Clackett and me are willin'
to bear it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," cried Matt hotly, "that you have
deliberately sailed away from Belize without permission
from Captain Nemo, Jr., or from me?"</p>

<p>"That's the size of it," was the respectful but decisive
answer. "We know that the cap'n would tell us to go
ahead and help the don. We ain't finding any fault with
you for not doing it on your own hook, 'cause you're a
stickler for what you think's your duty. We feel we're
doin' right, though, and we want you to feel the same
way."</p>

<p>"This is mutiny!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty hard name for it, Matt. I've been in
ships, man and boy, for thirty years, and this is the first
time any one ever accused me of mutiny. We just think
we know what ought to be done and are goin' ahead and
doin' it. You'll be able to tell the cap'n, when you next
see him, that you couldn't help yourself. Speake, Clackett
and me are banking on it that the cap'n'll say we did
just right."</p>

<p>This line of reasoning surprised Matt. For a moment
he was silent, turning it over in his mind.</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe this of you, Gaines," said the
young motorist finally. "How are you running the
ship?"</p>

<p>"We're short-handed, and that's a fact; still, we're making
shift to get along. We're running on the surface, so
Clackett don't have anything to do in the tank room, and
he's running the engine."</p>

<p>"Who's doing the steering?"</p>

<p>"The don's doing that. He knows the coast, he says,
and he seems to be right handy with the wheel. But I'm
watchin' to see that he don't make any flukes."</p>

<p>"You'll have us on the rocks first thing you know!"
cried Matt. "Put her about and go back to Belize."</p>

<p>"You might just as well understand, Matt," answered
Gaines firmly, "that we've started on this business and
we're going to see it through. We want your good will&mdash;and
we think you'll give it to us before we're done with
this cruise. It's a short cruise, anyhow, and we ought to
be back at Belize by to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"If anything happens to the <i>Grampus</i>," said Matt,
"you'll be held responsible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're willin'. We went into this with our eyes wide
open. First thing we did was to shut both doors of that
room and lock 'em; then we heaved up the anchors as
quiet as we could, and you and Dick were so sound asleep
you didn't hear a thing. It's two in the morning now,
and we're well down the coast&mdash;so far down that we
might as well see this thing through as to put back. Don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't appear to make much difference what I
think," said Matt grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, not a terrible sight," went on Gaines, "only, as
I said, we'd rather have your good will than your bad."</p>

<p>"How did you work this? How did the don get
back?"</p>

<p>"He stood off and on in the sailboat. As soon as you
were asleep, Clackett and I dickered with him and he
came aboard."</p>

<p>"I haven't much of an opinion of Don Ramon Ortega!"
exclaimed Matt. "Any man who will hire a crew to disobey
orders has a crooked strain in him somewhere."</p>

<p>"We're doin' this for humanity," asserted Gaines, in a
highly virtuous tone.</p>

<p>"Bosh," scoffed Matt. "You're doing it for five thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;which you won't
get."</p>

<p>"Won't get?" demanded Gaines, in ludicrous alarm.</p>

<p>"That's my view of it, Gaines. There's something
wrong with Don Ramon. After what he's done, I'm positive
that he told us a pretty tall yarn. Let me out of
here!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, but it ain't to be thought of&mdash;just yet. When
you and Dick will promise to go with us, and not make
any trouble, we'll let you out."</p>

<p>"Looks like we'd have to go with you whether we
wanted to or not, you old pirate!" cried Dick.</p>

<p>"Aren't you with us, Dick?" called Gaines, in a pleading
voice. "We hate to have the two of you against
us."</p>

<p>"With you," whooped Dick, "and against my old
raggie, Motor Matt? Well, I should say not! You're a
lot of blooming beach combers to act in this way."</p>

<p>"But you thought the don's proposition was all right."</p>

<p>"Vast, there, about what I thought of the don or his
proposition&mdash;it's what Matt thought about it that cuts
ice with me. Oh, you're a nice lot of swabs, you are! If
you know when you're well off, you'll haul that don out
of the conning tower and put him in double irons; then
you'll let Matt and me out of here and obey orders. It's
not too late yet to undo the trouble you've caused. Just
let that bounce around in your locker for a while and see
what you make of it."</p>

<p>"We're in this thing now, and we're going to hang to
it," was the dogged response.</p>

<p>Gaines turned away and the two chums could hear him
moving off. Matt went over to his cot and sat down.</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" he exclaimed. "Who'd ever have
thought Speake, Gaines and Clackett would take the bit
in their teeth like this?"</p>

<p>"They mean well, matey," said Dick, with a grim laugh.
"They are trying to take the responsibility off your shoulders,
Matt. They could see that you were hungry to go
with the don, but that you didn't think you had the right.
They've shouldered that part of it themselves."</p>

<p>"And they've got the lot of us into trouble," said Matt.
"There's something off color about Don Ramon Ortega
or he wouldn't have hired Speake, Gaines and Clackett
to do this directly against my orders."</p>

<p>"Don Ramon is a pretty high jigger in Belize."</p>

<p>"He's not what I thought he was."</p>

<p>"Well, we're in for it," laughed Dick.</p>

<p>"In more ways than one," said Matt moodily.</p>

<p>"We're bound for the Izaral again, and will probably
save that devoted outfit of 'breeds commanded by General
Mendez."</p>

<p>"If I can get out of here they'll never put this boat
into the River Izaral."</p>

<p>"That's my game old raggie for you!" exclaimed Dick.
"But what could you do, matey? There are four against
us, counting the don&mdash;two to one."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best. As for Gaines, Speake and Clackett,
they wouldn't dare lay hands on me. I can take care of
the don, I guess!" and Matt's gray eyes flashed dangerously.</p>

<p>"They'll not let us out of here, old ship," said Dick.
"Gaines and the rest know their business."</p>

<p>The steel room was as solid as a prison cell. There
were small ventilators for admitting fresh air, but these
were no larger than loopholes. Apart from the ventilators
there were absolutely no other openings in the metal
walls except the closed doors.</p>

<p>Matt laid down on the cot again and continued turning
the situation over in his mind.</p>

<p>The thing that worried him was the possibility of the
cruiser <i>Seminole</i> putting in at Belize with orders for the
<i>Grampus</i>&mdash;orders which might have something to do with
the sale of the boat to the United States government.</p>

<p>Matt, who was in Captain Nemo, Jr.'s, confidence
more than any of the others, understood that such a sale
was the object for which the captain was striving&mdash;that
it was that, and nothing else, which had led him to bring
the submarine into Central American waters. And now
to have the captain run the risk of losing a sale through
the misguided and utterly unwarranted action of Speake,
Clackett and Gaines was a hard thing to bear.</p>

<p>Yet Matt could see no way out of the difficulty. Gaines
and his two shipmates were determined to help the don,
and the boat was well along toward the Izaral.</p>

<p>For three or four hours Matt lay sleeplessly on his cot,
listening to the hum of the motor and rolling back and
forth with the rough swaying of the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he was brought up with a start. The
steady song of the cylinders had given way to an ineffectual
popping, and he knew that something had gone wrong.
The propeller ceased its revolutions, and the submarine
came to a dead stop and rolled helplessly in the swell.</p>

<p>"Something's busted," remarked Dick, sitting up.</p>

<p>Muffled voices could be heard and sounds of movements
as though one of the crew were going aft to the
engine room.</p>

<p>Sputter, sputter, pop, pop, pop!</p>

<p>Again and again the noise reached Matt's ears, but the
motor would not take the spark properly.</p>

<p>After half an hour of this, some one banged a fist
sharply against the other side of the door.</p>

<p>"Matt!" called the voice of Gaines.</p>

<p>"Well?" answered the young motorist.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go and fix up the motor. I'll be
hanged if I can do it."</p>

<p>"You're running the boat," said Matt. "Fix it up yourself."</p>

<p>"I tell you it's too many for me!"</p>

<p>"You ought to have thought that something like that
might happen before you started out. You're in trouble
now, so get out of it the best you can."</p>

<p>Matt, highly enjoying the situation, settled back on his
cot.</p>

<p>"Something has got to be done quick," cried Gaines,
"for we're in danger!"</p>

<p>"What sort of danger?" Matt had bounded from the
cot and was close to the door as he spoke.</p>

<p>"There's a line of reefs on the port side, and the current
is drawing us that way! Unless we get the propeller
to work in less than fifteen minutes the <i>Grampus</i> will be
wrecked!"</p>

<p>"Open the door!" said Matt sharply.</p>

<p>"You won't make us any trouble?" parried Gaines.</p>

<p>"Open the door, I tell you!" shouted Matt. "We
haven't a minute to lose!"</p>

<p>Without a promise to bind him as to his future course,
Matt was allowed to leave the steel room. Paying no
attention to the don, who was standing in the periscope
chamber, he rushed through another door, dropped down
a narrow hatch and crawled aft to the motor room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A LESSON IN "WHO'S WHO."</p>


<p>In order to reach the motor room Matt had to crawl
through a low chamber closely packed with storage batteries.
There were sixty cells with a power of one hundred
and sixty volts, and with a capacity of what is
known, in electrical parlance, as sixteen hundred ampere
hours. This room was Speake's dominion, and he sat
on a low stool, his head just clearing the deck above,
watching furtively as Matt scrambled past him.</p>

<p>Tucked away in the stern, at the end of the floored
space, was the motor room. It looked like the tunnel
shaft of an ocean liner.</p>

<p>At one side there were switchboards for two dynamotors:
one of ten horse power to compress air, and a
second of two horse power to supply lights and assist the
ventilation. The spiral resistance coils were close to the
switchboards. The gasoline engine was in the centre of
the compartment, and back of this stretched the shaft,
finally passing out into the water through a stuffing box.</p>

<p>Matt glanced at a clock on the wall. From somewhere
in the distance he could hear breakers churning soddenly
against a reef.</p>

<p>Clackett, crouching low in the curve of the boat's side,
looked anxiously at Matt. He paid no attention to
Clackett, but gave the fly wheel a sharp turn.</p>

<p>Sputter, pop, pop!</p>

<p>Matt listened. It was marvelous how completely he
was in touch with the engine.</p>

<p>"Did you strain the gasoline before you put it into
the tank?" he demanded of Clackett.</p>

<p>"Always do that, Matt," was the reply.</p>

<p>"The carburetter valve is clogged. Lay hold here."</p>

<p>In ten minutes the valve was clear, the engine "turned
over" and the motor working properly. Matt switched
the power into the propeller.</p>

<p>"All right, periscope room!" he called through a tube.</p>

<p>"Bully!" came back the voice of Gaines. "We were
almost on the rocks. You're the boy, Matt!"</p>

<p>"Send Dick Ferral down here," ordered Matt curtly.</p>

<p>Dick presently appeared.</p>

<p>"Take charge of the engine, Dick," said Matt.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, matey?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"You'll know in a few minutes." He turned to
Clackett. "Go up to the periscope room, Clackett," he
went on. "I may need you."</p>

<p>"But say, Matt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard what I said!"</p>

<p>There was that in Motor Matt's voice and eyes that sent
Clackett crawling forward along the passage.</p>

<p>Matt followed him. In the battery room they picked
up Speake, and Matt sent him trailing after Clackett.
In that order all three finally gained the periscope room.</p>

<p>"What the blazes is the matter with you fellows?"
shouted Gaines.</p>

<p>He was doing the steering himself, and was standing
by the periscope table.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes on the periscope," said Matt. "Attend
to your work, Gaines."</p>

<p>Matt whirled about to where the don was sitting on a
stool. There was a sharp gleam in the Spaniard's eyes,
although he was otherwise cool and perfectly collected.</p>

<p>"This is a good time to give you fellows a lesson in
who's who aboard the <i>Grampus</i>," said Matt. "Don
Ramon, you did a rascally thing when you hired these
men to take you south in direct defiance of my orders."</p>

<p>"What of it?" The don shrugged his shoulders. "We'll
soon be at the mouth of the Izaral&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are <i>not</i> going to the Izaral River," cut in Matt.
"We are going back to Belize."</p>

<p>"We are not going back to Belize until we finish our
work in the Izaral," was the insolent response.</p>

<p>"No?" returned Matt coolly. "We'll see. Gaines?" he
called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," answered Gaines, keeping his eyes on
the periscope.</p>

<p>"Put about!"</p>

<p>Gaines made no move to shift the wheel.</p>

<p>"You heard what I said, Gaines?" went on Matt, his
voice pitched low but carrying an emphasis that lifted it
above the hum of the motor.</p>

<p>"I heard you, Matt," replied Gaines.</p>

<p>"Either obey the order or give up the wheel to
Clackett."</p>

<p>Brought directly face to face with the issue, Gaines
hesitated. The sharp eyes of the don noted the effect
the masterful young motorist's words were having on
Gaines.</p>

<p>"Don't you do it, Gaines," said the don coolly. "Think
of the money you're to get. Motor Matt has not the
courage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk foolish!" growled Gaines. "Matt's got
more pluck in a minute than any of the rest of us have in
a year. I know him."</p>

<p>"He hasn't the courage to go to the Izaral," growled
the don.</p>

<p>"He's only off'n his course a little about that," answered
Gaines.</p>

<p>"Will you obey orders, Gaines, or leave your post?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"He'll obey my orders," flashed the don, "and he'll
stay right where he is and hold to his present course."</p>

<p>As the don spoke he pulled a hand from the breast of
his coat. The hand gripped a revolver.</p>

<p>"That's your game, is it?" asked Matt, peering steadily
into the snaky orbs of the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"We have come thus far on my mission," returned
the don, "and we are going the rest of the way."</p>

<p>"Put up that gun!" said Gaines angrily. "If you try
any shootin', we'll throw our hands in the air and put
back to Belize."</p>

<p>Speake and Clackett moved forward. Matt waved
them aside.</p>

<p>"I'll manage this," said he. "Gaines, keep your eyes
on the periscope. A fine fellow, this don of yours. You
men ought to feel proud of the way you hooked up with
him, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt, while he was talking, had kept covert eyes on the
don. At just that moment the <i>Grampus</i> gave a heavy roll.
The don's stool slid back against the steel wall and the
point of the revolver was thrown, for the fraction of a
second, toward the curving deck, overhead. This was
Matt's opportunity. Quick as a flash he hurled himself
upon the Spaniard, bore him from the stool and they
rolled over and over upon the heaving floor.</p>

<p>The struggle lasted only a few moments, and when
Matt withdrew from the don and got to his feet, he was
holding the revolver.</p>

<p>"I'll make you answer for this!" cried the don, in a
furious temper.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to try&mdash;just as soon as we get back
to Belize," said Matt. "If this matter is aired, it won't
sound very well when your government hears of it."</p>

<p>A mocking light crossed the don's angry face.</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" he exclaimed. "I'm not afraid of my government."</p>

<p>"Throw it overboard, Speake," said Matt, handing the
revolver to Speake. "We don't need that thing here.
If I can't have obedience on the <i>Grampus</i> without looking
at her crew over the sights of a gun, I don't want it."</p>

<p>Speake, without a word, took the revolver and went up
the ladder into the conning tower.</p>

<p>"From this on, Don Ramon Ortega," said Matt, "you
will consider yourself a passenger. I will treat you better
than your conduct demands, and will not make a prisoner
of you unless you attempt to interfere with the management
of the boat. Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>The don muttered something under his breath.</p>

<p>Before Matt could speak further, a shout came from
Speake.</p>

<p>"Small boat off the starboard beam, close in!"</p>

<p>"By Jupiter!" exclaimed Gaines, pushing farther into
the hood of the periscope. "Look here, Matt!"</p>

<p>As Matt turned, an evil, triumphant light flashed in the
don's eyes. Matt could not see it, and it escaped Clackett.</p>

<p>In the mirror top of the periscope table, clear and distinct,
was reflected a ship's boat, a yawl, heaving helplessly
on the waves. The boat was not over a hundred
feet from the submarine, and the periscope showed it with
startling fidelity to detail.</p>

<p>Aboard the yawl were five persons&mdash;four men and a
boy. They seemed to be in difficult straits, for the men
were standing erect and waving their hats frantically.</p>

<p>"They've been shipwrecked, Matt," said Gaines, "and
they've lost their oars."</p>

<p>One of the men was a burly individual, wearing an oilskin
coat and a sou'wester. All the others were roughly
dressed, the boy wearing a pea-jacket and a stocking cap
pulled well down over his face.</p>

<p>"There's a sailing craft hull down, off to port," said
Matt. "It's a wonder that boat didn't pick those fellows
up. But that's unimportant. We'll lay them aboard and
take them off. Clackett!"</p>

<p>"Here, Matt!" answered Clackett.</p>

<p>"Take two coils of rope and go aloft." Matt turned
to Gaines. "Get as close to the boat as you can, Gaines,"
he added.</p>

<p>Clackett rushed up the conning-tower ladder, and followed
Speake out onto the curving plates of the deck.
Matt went after the two men to direct operations from
the conning tower.</p>

<p>Those in the boat&mdash;with the exception of the boy&mdash;appeared
in the last stages of exhaustion. On seeing that
their wild signals were to be answered, they dropped
sprawling over the thwarts.</p>

<p>The boy still stood erect and made gestures&mdash;stealthy
movements with one hand which puzzled Matt.</p>

<p>"That youngster seems to have stood their hard luck
better'n the men," remarked Clackett, moving toward
the bow with a coil of rope.</p>

<p>Matt made no answer, but continued to watch the dancing
yawl as Gaines brought the submarine steadily
nearer.</p>

<p>"Stand by to catch a rope!" shouted Matt presently,
when they were close enough for a cast. "Let 'er go,
Clackett!"</p>

<p>The rope left Clackett's hand, untwined itself sinuously
in the air, and the end of it was grabbed by the big fellow
in the sou'wester.</p>

<p>"All fast!" he boomed in a voice that was strangely
strong for one whose actions showed him to be nearly
fagged out.</p>

<p>Speake's rope was then thrown, and thus, with a double
cable, the yawl was drawn close against the rounded side
of the submarine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>In the periscope room were only the don and Gaines.
Gaines' head was shrouded by the folds of the black periscope
hood, and the don, unseen, was rubbing his hands
delightedly.</p>

<p>The yawl was on the windward side of the <i>Grampus</i>.
Matt, calling down directions to Gaines, had the submarine
brought about so that the yawl lay on the lee side.
This, to some extent, gave smoother water for the unloading
of the small boat's passengers.</p>

<p>Speake, holding to one of the wire guys that supported
the periscope tube, descended the rounded deck until up
to his knees in water. Stretching out his hand he caught
the fist of the big fellow in the sou'wester. The latter,
standing on the gunwale of the yawl, gave a leap and
landed sprawling on the submarine's deck.</p>

<p>A wave rolled over him, but he managed to clutch the
guy rope and hang on. The next moment he rolled over
close to the conning tower and lay there, face down, apparently
almost spent.</p>

<p>Clackett, imitating Speake's maneuvre, was bringing
another of the men aboard. One by one the yawl was
unloaded, the boy being the last to come.</p>

<p>Matt, climbing out of the conning tower, ordered the
rescued men below. Two of them had vanished through
the hatch when Matt, bending over the big fellow by the
base of the conning tower, asked him who he and his
comrades were, and how they happened to be adrift in a
small boat.</p>

<p>"Had er shipwreck," answered the man hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Can't you get up?" asked Matt. "We'll have to get
you below, somehow."</p>

<p>"Mebby I kin make it if yer put yer arms under mine
an' give me a lift."</p>

<p>Bracing himself on the deck, Matt reached downward
and pushed his hands under the man's armpits. At the
same moment, the big fellow developed a surprising
amount of strength. Both his arms went upward, as he
whirled over on his back, and closed about Matt's waist
like the two jaws of a vise.</p>

<p>"Now, then, nail 'em, you swabs!" he roared. "I got
the boss o' the gang, an' you git the rest!"</p>

<p>Not until that moment did Motor Matt suspect treachery.
The revelation came to him like a lightning flash.</p>

<p>A wild uproar echoed from below, and forward and
aft Speake and Clackett were struggling with those they
had helped aboard.</p>

<p>The rounded deck of the <i>Grampus</i>, slippery with water
and deluged again and again by the waves, was a fearsome
place for such a struggle. How the combatants
ever kept themselves out of the sea was a mystery.</p>

<p>Matt fought as best he could. He recognized the big
fellow as Abner Fingal, and knew, as well as though he
had been told, that Don Ramon Ortega had engineered
a cunning plot for the capture of the submarine.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do, Fingal?" Matt demanded,
as the scoundrel held him helpless in his iron-like grip.</p>

<p>"Trying to even up fer some o' the things you done a
spell ago!" roared Fingal. "Stop yer squirmin', or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a fierce effort, Matt succeeded in breaking free.
He rose to his knees, only to meet the flint-like fist of
Fingal. The terrific blow hurled him backward, and he
slid along the sloping deck against the guy rope that supported
the small flagstaff, close to the bow.</p>

<p>Fingal jumped after him, caught him by the collar and
pulled him back before he could slip from the support of
the rope and drop into the sea. The jerk Fingal gave
him hurled Matt headfirst against the iron socket in
which the base of the staff was secured to the deck. It
was a savage blow, and Matt straightened out limply and
a wave of darkness rolled over him.</p>

<p>When Matt opened his eyes again, he was in the same
room where he and Dick had been confined by Gaines,
Speake and Clackett. But there was another prisoner
now, for Speake was with Matt and Dick.</p>

<p>Dick, on a stool beside the cot, was rubbing Matt's
temples. Across from them, on the other cot, Speake was
sitting, nursing a bruise on the side of his face.</p>

<p>"Hard luck, old ship!" muttered Dick ominously.
"How are you feeling?"</p>

<p>"None too good," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"You got a crack fore and aft. It's a wonder one of
'em didn't bash in your skull."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the blows I received that's hurting me now,
Dick," Matt went on, "but the fact that we were trapped
when we thought we were helping a boat load of shipwrecked
sailors. Have they captured the boat?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say! That outfit of pirates swarmed all
over her. I was down in the engine room, you know, and,
while I knew by the racket that something was happening
that wasn't down on the bills, yet I didn't dare leave
the motor. After a while the racket died out a little and
I called up through the speaking tube to learn what was
going on. Some one laughed; then, the next I knew,
Fingal came driving Gaines along. A swab trailed after
Fingal, and both of 'em had guns. I was ordered up to
the periscope room, and Gaines was sent to the motor, the
other chap staying with him and keeping the gun aimed
at him all the time. Oh, I guess you fellows have got
enough of helping the don, haven't you?" and Dick
turned to Speake.</p>

<p>"We was a pack of fools," answered Speake.</p>

<p>"What happened to you, Speake?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"The same as happened to all the rest," was the growling
response. "That was a husky lot o' shipwrecked
mariners we picked up! They didn't seem hardly able
to crawl aboard, but they woke up considerable as soon
as they got their feet on the <i>Grampus'</i> deck. I had it
which an' t'other with a chap for'ard o' the connin' tower,
and I held my own until Clackett was downed and the
man that was goin' for him came at me. Then, o' course,
I had to give up. Clackett an' me was sent below at the
pistol's p'int. Clackett's in the tank room, and Gaines
is in the motor room, both with a couple of the thieves
holdin' guns on them an' makin' 'em run the boat. The
don's steerin', and we're hikin' right on toward Port
Livingston. Oh, what a howlin' mess!"</p>

<p>Matt sat up and bowed his head in his hands for a moment.
His brain ached, and he was trying to think and
get at the full extent of the disaster.</p>

<p>"It was all a put-up job, matey," remarked Dick.</p>

<p>"That's easy to guess, Dick," returned Matt, lifting his
head. "The boat I saw hull down, off on the port side of
us, must have been Fingal's schooner, the <i>North Star</i>.
The schooner was expecting the don along with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<i>Grampus</i>, and was laying to get that crew of rascals
aboard of us. Dropping the yawl in the water, the
schooner left the boat behind. Oh, I see it all now. But
I can't understand this Don Ramon Ortega. This business
will open the eyes of a good many people in Belize."</p>

<p>"But what's the upshot of it all? What's the don tryin'
to do?"</p>

<p>This from Speake, as he continued to nurse his injury.</p>

<p>"I can smoke Fingal's roll, all right enough," said
Dick. "He's playing even with us for what we did on
the Izaral River, a few days ago."</p>

<p>"He has captured the <i>Grampus</i>," added Matt, "and
probably intends to turn her over to General Pitou."</p>

<p>"An' there wasn't anythin' in that story of the don's?"
asked Speake. "It was a pretty good story, an' sounded
to me like it might be straight goods."</p>

<p>"The don is helping Fingal," returned Matt, "and the
submarine is now in the hands of the five we 'rescued'
from the yawl, and the don. There are six of our enemies
and only five of us. Naturally, we don't count, being
locked up in this steel room; and Gaines and Clackett
can't count for much, either, with revolvers staring them
in the face whichever way they turn. This is a hard row
of stumps for us, pards!"</p>

<p>"An' all owin' to Clackett, an' Gaines, an' me!"
mourned Speake.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be gained thinking over that part
of it, Speake," said Matt. "We've got to look this
thing squarely in the face and do what we can to recapture
the submarine."</p>

<p>"Nothin' we can do!" grunted Speake. "That outfit
of roughs have got the whip hand of us, and they're going
to keep it. They was wise to keep Gaines an' Clackett
to attend to the runnin' of the machinery, an' I guess the
don can do the steerin', easy enough."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there was any truth at all in the don's
story?" ventured Matt.</p>

<p>"In what part of it, matey?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"Why, about the revolutionists capturing Port Livingston,
and the fort across the river."</p>

<p>"If part o' his yarn's crooked," grumbled Speake,
"then I'll gamble the whole of it's crooked. Why, Matt?
What difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"Well, if Port Livingston is in the hands of the revolutionists,
then we'll be taken there, and not up the
Izaral."</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" exclaimed Dick, as a sudden
thought came to him. "Don Ramon Ortega is in mighty
poor business, mates, if he's helping these revolutionists.
What a two-faced swab he is! When he talked with us,
last evening, he was all against the rebels; now he's for
them. What will the Spanish government say to that sort
of work?"</p>

<p>"There's something about Don Ramon that's mighty
puzzling," said Matt. "He's a scheming scoundrel,
though, and it's our business to recapture the <i>Grampus</i>&mdash;if
we can."</p>

<p>"How'll we go to work, Matt?" asked Speake gloomily.
"Every man in Fingal's party is armed. What could
five of us do ag'inst six armed men, providin' we was
able to bunch together and face 'em?"</p>

<p>At this point, the door leading into the periscope room
opened and the don and Fingal stepped through. Matt,
Dick and Speake all started up on the entrance of the two
men, but the latter carried revolvers, and another armed
man stood in the doorway behind them.</p>

<p>"Don't get reckless, you fellows!" warned Fingal. "We
ain't particularly anxious to hurt ye, but there's no tellin'
what'll happen if you try to climb over us an' git through
that door." The burly ruffian turned toward his companion.
"Fire away, don," he added, "and tell 'em what
you got on your mind."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE DON'S PROPOSAL.</p>


<p>Before the don could follow Fingal's suggestion and
unburden himself of what he wanted to say, the splash
and gurgle of water entering the submersion tanks
reached the ears of those in the steel room. At the same
moment a shiver ran through the boat's fabric and she
began to sink.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" demanded Matt sharply.</p>

<p>"Going under the water," explained the don affably.
"We're off Port Livingston and are going to proceed up
the Izaral without being seen."</p>

<p>"What's that for? If the town and the fort are in the
hands of the rebels, you won't have anything to fear."</p>

<p>"We don't know whether the rebels have captured the
fort yet or not," said the don, "and we don't want to take
any chances of being sunk by the fort's guns in case they
are still in the hands of the enemy."</p>

<p>"If you don't know anything about this boat," said
Matt, "you'll get us all into trouble trying to maneuvre
it."</p>

<p>"Gaines an' Clackett, I guess," put in Fingal, "'ll keep
us from gettin' inter any very serious fix. They're helpin'
run the craft, ye know," and Fingal leered cunningly.
"Go ahead, don," he added, as the submarine halted its
downward plunge and started onward again.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," said the don, "I have a proposition to
make to you and your men. You will find it to your interest,
I think, to accept it."</p>

<p>"What's the proposition?" asked Matt curtly.</p>

<p>The more Motor Matt studied Don Ramon, the more
puzzling the man became. His English was good, and
yet he was undeniably of Spanish descent. Somehow
Matt was gathering the idea that the don was a native
of Central America, and not of Spain; yet Matt knew
that this could not be, for he had heard that the Spanish
consul at Belize hailed from Barcelona.</p>

<p>"My friend, Fingal," proceeded the don, "appears to
think that you and your men owe him something on account
of what happened during your former visit to the
River Izaral, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So they do!" growled Fingal, with a savage frown;
"they owe me somethin' not only on account o' that, but
on account o' my brother, Jim Sixty. If it hadn't been
for them, Jim would never have got nabbed by the
United States' gov'ment for filibusterin'. I swore I'd
git even with 'em for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget that for a little, Fingal," interposed the don.
"I've reasoned with Fingal," he went on to Matt, "and
he has agreed to let bygones be bygones, providing you
fall in with our plans."</p>

<p>He paused, his piercing eyes on the young motorist's
face.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting to hear what your plans are," said Matt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"We captured this boat for the revolutionists," continued
the don, "and she will be of great help to General
Pitou in his work; but, in order to be as efficient as possible,
the craft ought to be manned with her regular
crew. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then that story you told us about General Mendez,
and about the trap Pitou was laying for him, was untrue?"</p>

<p>"Much of it was not the exact truth," the don cheerfully
admitted. "General Mendez and his force are not
far from the Purgatoire River, but it is he who is laying
the trap for Pitou, and not Pitou for him. General Pitou
will have to capture the fort at the mouth of the Izaral
and be able to turn its guns on General Mendez, or the
loyalist forces will drive the rebels into the sea. In
order to keep track of Mendez, we need the submarine
for scout duty up and down the river. Now, Motor
Matt, you are thoroughly familiar with the boat, and our
proposal is that you and your men take charge of her
and render gallant service for General Pitou. Some of
our men, of course, will stay on the boat to make sure
that you prove faithful to your promises to us, but that
will be a mere formality.</p>

<p>"If you will do this, I promise to pay you the sum, in
gold, that I mentioned when talking to you in the harbor
at Belize. Furthermore, in the event that General Pitou's
uprising is successful, and we make him dictator of the
country, you and your friends will share liberally in the
division of the spoils. What do you say? You are young
men&mdash;mere youths, in fact&mdash;and such a golden prospect
ought to appeal to you."</p>

<p>Matt stared at the don.</p>

<p>"And you," he breathed, "are the Spanish consul at
Belize! What would happen to you if they knew, in
Spain, how you are meddling with the affairs of a country
with which your own is at peace?"</p>

<p>The don laughed.</p>

<p>"I might just as well puncture that bubble here and
now," said he. "I am not Don Ramon Ortega, the Spanish
consul, but Don Carlos Valdez, the revolutionist."</p>

<p>Matt started back.</p>

<p>"Don Carlos Valdez!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Now, sink me!" cried Dick. "We heard about you
in Belize, Don Carlos."</p>

<p>"And what do they say about me in Belize? asked
the don.</p>

<p>"Why, that you're the greatest rascal unhung!"</p>

<p>"They say more than that," added Speake wrathfully,
"and that you'll <i>be</i> hung, one o' these fine days."</p>

<p>Speake was chagrined and spiteful because of the way
he and his mates had been taken in by the plausible revolutionist
at the start off. He saw, now, how farsighted
Motor Matt was in refusing to have anything to do with
the don.</p>

<p>Carlos Valdez smiled ironically.</p>

<p>"What they say doesn't make any material difference,"
he answered. "I have been in Belize for a week. I
walked the streets openly, and no one dared to molest
me. Why, I even went to the Spanish consul and asked
for a passport. While he was preparing to make it out,
I felled him with a blow and left him bound and gagged
in his own sitting room. I had to do that, you see, before
I dared to call on you, Motor Matt, and impersonate
him."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Motor Matt, "I am glad of one
thing."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"That Don Ramon Ortega is not the villain I know
you to be."</p>

<p>"Your opinion counts for as little as does that of the
people of Belize," returned the don easily. "You have
not answered my question as to whether you and your
men would accept our proposal."</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was necessary to answer it," said
Matt. "I would blow up the <i>Grampus</i> before I would
allow her to fall into the hands of General Pitou."</p>

<p>"Better think well before you make a foolish answer
like that," struck in Fingal.</p>

<p>"That's my answer, just the same."</p>

<p>"How about the rest of you?" and the don turned to
Dick and Speake.</p>

<p>"What Motor Matt says matches my sentiments to a
dot," replied Dick.</p>

<p>"Mine, too," added Speake. "If me and my mates
had obeyed Motor Matt like we'd ought to have done,
we'd never have got into this fix in the first place. It
may be a little late in the day, but here's where I begin
carryin' out his orders jest as he gives 'em."</p>

<p>"Do you know what this decision means?" queried the
don gravely.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of that, but of my duty to Captain
Nemo, Jr.," said Matt.</p>

<p>"It means," fumed Fingal, enraged at the refusal of
Matt and his friends to cast their lot with the revolutionists,
"that you'll never live to get back to Belize!"</p>

<p>"Or even back down the river to Port Livingston,"
supplemented the don. "Presently we are going to tie
up at an old landing on the river bank. After that, we
will leave you by yourselves until nightfall. This will
give you a little more time to think over our proposition.
Life is a pleasant thing to young men like you,
and you ought not to cast it lightly aside. Come on, Fingal,"
he finished.</p>

<p>The don and Fingal stepped back into the periscope
room, closing and locking the door behind them.</p>

<p>Dick went over to his cot and sat down with a mirthless
laugh.</p>

<p>"The old hunks has given us his ultimatum," said he.
"We must either run the submarine for the revolutionists,
or go to Davy Jones. Pleasant prospect, eh, matey?"</p>

<p>"Wonder if they've batted up the same proposition to
Gaines and Clackett?" mused Speake.</p>

<p>"Probably they have," said Matt. "They want to secure
the services of the submarine's crew, and Gaines and
Clackett are important members of the ship's company."</p>

<p>"What sort of a move would it be," suggested Dick,
"to pretend to join the swabs and then, watching our
chances, cut and run back to Belize?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't trust us even if we agreed to join
them. Didn't you hear what was said about having an
armed guard constantly on the boat, as a 'mere formality'?
No, Dick, the best thing for us will be to come out
flatfooted and let the rascals know just where we stand.
If they attempt to take any desperate measures against
us, we will claim the protection of Old Glory."</p>

<p>"What do they care about a piece of bunting?" returned
Dick. "See how they ran off that American consul?
Why, these revolutionists aren't responsible for anything,
matey, and they'll do just what they please."</p>

<p>In his own heart, Matt himself felt that Dick was stating
the exact truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>While the boys and Speake were talking, the turbines
could be heard emptying the ballast tanks, and the boat
began slowly rising. A little later the boys knew they
were on the surface of the river. Steps were heard running
along the deck, overhead, and a sound of voices came
to them. Then there was a bumping along one side of
the hull, a stopping of the motor, and the submarine was
at a halt.</p>

<p>"I suppose we're tied up at that bally landing," observed
Dick, "and here we're to stay and think matters
over until nightfall, as the don put it. By the way, isn't
it about time to eat? You and I, Matt, haven't had a
mouthful since last night."</p>

<p>The words were hardly off of Dick's lips when the
door leading into the periscope room opened and closed.
The prisoners caught a glimpse of armed men standing
in the other chamber, and then gave their attention to
the boy who had entered with a basket.</p>

<p>The lad still had his stocking cap drawn down over
his ears, and the collar of his jacket turned up about his
throat.</p>

<p>"What have you got?" demanded Speake. "If it's
grub, set it down. We was jest wonderin' if your outfit
was calculatin' on starvin' us to death."</p>

<p>The boy's actions were peculiar, to say the least. Laying
a finger on his lips, he bent his ear to the edge of the
door and listened; then, turning around, he jerked off his
stocking cap.</p>

<p>"Matt," he whispered excitedly, "don't you know me?"</p>

<p>Matt gazed at the lad's handsome face like one stupefied.</p>

<p>"Ysabel!" he murmured; "Ysabel Sixty!"</p>

<p>"Jupiter!" gasped Speake.</p>

<p>"Great guns!" muttered Dick.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">YSABEL SIXTY'S LOYALTY.</p>


<p>The astonishment of all three of the prisoners was
overwhelming. Ysabel Sixty, the daughter of Captain
Jim Sixty, the captured filibuster, there aboard the
<i>Grampus</i>! She was so artfully disguised, too, that the
prisoners would never have recognized her had she not
taken the pains to reveal her identity.</p>

<p>Ysabel set the basket down on the floor.</p>

<p>"Fingal and all the others except Don Carlos are eating,"
said she, in a low voice. "The don has gone ashore
to hunt for revolutionists. My uncle made me get the
meal for him and his men, and then sent me here with
something for you."</p>

<p>"You are still a friend of ours, Ysabel?" whispered
Matt.</p>

<p>"Always!" the girl breathed.</p>

<p>"Does your uncle, Abner Fingal, know that?"</p>

<p>"Of course not! Why, he doesn't even know I am
Ysabel Sixty!" She gave a low, sibilant laugh. "I have
fooled him as well as the others."</p>

<p>It hardly seemed possible that the girl could hide her
identity from her uncle simply by donning male attire.
And yet she looked vastly different in boy's clothes.</p>

<p>"I'll not be able to stay here long," proceeded Ysabel,
"so you had better let me do most of the talking. The
<i>North Star</i>, Abner Fingal's schooner, lay off Belize part
of the day, yesterday. She had been repainted, renamed,
and was flying the Cuban flag. No one recognized her as
a filibuster's boat. Fingal came ashore and had a talk
with Don Carlos, and together they plotted to capture
the submarine. And I also plotted," said the girl.
"That's how I happen to be here now."</p>

<p>"But how did you learn about the plot?" queried Matt
breathlessly, "and how did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"You remember my old friend, Pedro? The man who
used to sail on my father's ship, the <i>Dolphin</i>?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, as it chanced, Pedro came north on the
schooner with Abner Fingal. My uncle values Pedro
highly because he was with my father on the brig, and
it was from him that Pedro learned that the object of the
schooner in going to Belize was to capture the submarine.
Pedro was sent ashore at Belize to find four or five white
men to help out the plot. He picked up three, and those
were all he could get who, according to his ideas, were
trustworthy. He called at the house in the evening, just
before the schooner was to sail, and talked with me.</p>

<p>"When I learned that Fingal was trying to capture the
submarine, and that Don Carlos was planning to help, I
was wild to get word to you, and warn you. But this was
impossible. You were not at the hotel, Pedro said, and
the doctor would not admit any one to talk with Captain
Nemo, Jr. I would have gone to the American consul,
but Pedro would not let me. He said that if I did
such a thing I would get everybody into trouble, himself
as well as my uncle. I cared little about Fingal, but I
did care a good deal about Pedro. He has always been
a true friend, and a great help, to me. If I couldn't warn
you, Matt, I made up my mind that I would sail with
the schooner and do what I could to aid you in case Don
Carlos' snare proved successful.</p>

<p>"Pedro tried to argue me out of that, but I insisted. At
last he went to a junk shop in town and bought a suit of
boy's clothes for me, and this stocking cap; then he cut
off my hair"&mdash;the girl shook her head and set the short
locks flying&mdash;"and I was soon changed into Manuel
Ybarra, a small brother of Pedro's. We went out to the
schooner in the evening. Fingal was already aboard and
waiting for us. After that we sailed south, and, in the
first gray of morning, we hove to, and Fingal himself
climbed to the masthead with a glass. He watched carefully
along our back track, and when he came sliding
down to the deck he said loudly, so all could hear, that
Don Carlos had succeeded in luring the submarine away
from Belize, and that now we must carry out our part of
the programme.</p>

<p>"Pedro and three other men were lined up on the
deck, and each was given a revolver; then a small boat
was put over and the four men got into the boat. Just
as they were about to cast off, I jumped in.</p>

<p>"Fingal swore and ordered me back, but Pedro begged
so hard for his 'little brother' that I was allowed to stay.
As soon as we had cast off from her side, the schooner
bore away with all sail set; then our boat was rowed off
over the water and the oars were tossed into the sea.</p>

<p>"'We're shipwrecked sailors,' said Fingal, with a
laugh. 'Play the part, every man of you! The submarine
will pick us up, an' then we'll capture her.'</p>

<p>"My heart turned sick at that, for not until then did
I understand what the plan was. I hoped that you would
not see us and pick us up; but then, Don Carlos was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the submarine, and it was certain that he would be on the
watch for us. You know what happened after that.
Didn't you see me motioning to you to keep away when
you were in the conning tower?"</p>

<p>"I saw you motioning, Ysabel," said Matt, "but hadn't
the least idea what you meant. You were well disguised,
and that stocking cap is just the thing. But be careful!
If Abner Fingal should discover who you really are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't," she answered. "Pedro is looking after
me. I am supposed to be his brother, you know."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can help us recapture the
<i>Grampus</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to do."</p>

<p>"Will Pedro help you?"</p>

<p>She was doubtful.</p>

<p>"Pedro won't do anything to get me into trouble, but
whether he would help or not I don't know. You see,
Matt, Pedro thought a lot of my father, and he doesn't
feel very kindly toward you and your friends. With me
it's different. My father was never good to me, but was
always beating me and forcing me to tell lies to help out
his plans. But," she added, catching herself up, "we
must only talk about important things. Pedro is on
guard at the door, eating his meal with a revolver on his
knee. He will let me stay in here as long as I like, but if
Fingal should suspect anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl winced and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You'd better go now, Ysabel," said Matt. "If Fingal
happened to find out who you are, at this time, it would
be impossible for you to do anything for us."</p>

<p>"I'd better tell you all I can, that's of importance, while
I'm here," insisted the girl, pulling her cap down over
her ears. "I may not have so good a chance as this
again."</p>

<p>"Where are we, Ysabel?" put in Dick.</p>

<p>"Tied up to an old landing, halfway between the mouth
of the Izaral and the place where the Purgatoire flows
into the stream."</p>

<p>"Are there any soldiers near here?"</p>

<p>"There are, unless General Pitou has captured the fort.
If the rebels have won that, then they're probably all
down at the mouth of the river."</p>

<p>"Where's General Mendez?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere near the Purgatoire. He's coming down
the river as fast as he can, hoping to fight with the rebels
before they can get to the fort."</p>

<p>"Why did Don Carlos go ashore?"</p>

<p>"To find General Pitou. If the general thinks it safe,
he may come back with Don Carlos."</p>

<p>"When does Don Carlos expect to get back here?" put
in Matt.</p>

<p>"That depends on how far away the rebels are. He
may return soon, and he may not return until nearly
night."</p>

<p>"About what time is it?"</p>

<p>"Nearly noon. Tell me, Matt, how you think I can
help you! I'm not nearly so clever as you are, and you
might be able to think of something I could do."</p>

<p>Matt was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p>"Where are Gaines and Clackett?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"They are shut up in the torpedo room. Fingal intends
to keep them shut up all the time they are not
needed for running the boat."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"What now, matey?" whispered Dick.</p>

<p>"Why, if necessary, one of those fellows could shoot
the other out through the torpedo tube! I got out that
way once, you remember, in Atlantic City, and the
<i>Grampus</i> was submerged, at that. Here she's on the
surface, and the mouth of the tube isn't more than two
feet under water!"</p>

<p>"What good would it do for one o' them fellers to be
shot out of the boat?" queried Speake. "He'd only find
himself in the hands of those outside."</p>

<p>"Well, Speake, if we got a chance to leave here and
run the revolutionists off the boat, one of the men from
the torpedo room would prove a big help to us. With
Don Carlos gone, there are only Fingal, Pedro, and two
more against us&mdash;and perhaps Ysabel could keep Pedro
from taking a very active part in the fighting."</p>

<p>"But there are the guns&mdash;consarn 'em!" growled Dick.
"What could we do against four, or even three, armed
men? They could riddle us before we got close enough
to use our fists."</p>

<p>"If I could take the cartridges out of the revolvers,"
said Ysabel, "wouldn't that help?"</p>

<p>"How could you do that?" queried Matt eagerly.
"Aren't the weapons in the men's pockets?"</p>

<p>"There were only four revolvers," went on the girl,
"and one of the men gave his to Don Carlos. That leaves
only three on the boat. Pedro has one, Fingal has one,
and one of the other men has one. If I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at this point the door opened and the swarthy
face of Pedro was thrust in.</p>

<p>"<i>Mujercita!</i>" he called softly.</p>

<p>The girl, with one last, quick look at Matt, hastened
from the room. The door was closed and locked, and
the prisoners could hear the hoarse voice of Fingal rumbling
through the periscope room. Matt glided to the
door and listened. A moment later he drew a long
breath of relief and turned away.</p>

<p>"I was afraid he might discover her," said he, "but he
only came down to borrow some tobacco of Pedro."</p>

<p>"About all we can do is to wait," murmured Speake.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Dick; "wait for something to happen
and hope for the best."</p>

<p>"And let's not forget, while we're waiting," added
Matt, "that we've got one loyal friend among our captors&mdash;and
she's as brave as she is loyal."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="chaptitle">AN OPPORTUNITY.</p>


<p>The three prisoners were hungry and they lost no time
in making an attack on the basket. While they ate they
discussed the situation in whispers.</p>

<p>"Did Fingal come down the ladder from the conning
tower, mate?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"I thought so," was the reply, "from the noise he
made."</p>

<p>"Did he go back to the deck?"</p>

<p>"I didn't wait to listen."</p>

<p>"If we could git that gang separated," said Speake,
"we could lay 'em out one at a time&mdash;an' I guess the revolvers
wouldn't cut much figure."</p>

<p>"That would be fine, Speake," returned Dick, "but
Fingal and his gang are not doing the things we want
'em to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we're to accomplish anything toward recapturing
the submarine," chimed in Matt, "we'll have to do it before
Don Carlos gets back. He may bring a gang of soldiers
with him. Besides, don't forget what's to happen
to us at nightfall in case we don't agree to join the revolutionists."</p>

<p>"I'm not pinin' to have my name wiped off the articles,"
said Speake, with a wry grimace. "For one, I'd
rather take long chances tryin' to run the rebels off the
boat. It's a heap more comfortin' to get done up that
way than by lettin' Fingal an' Pitou an' this Don Carlos
do what they please without never liftin' a hand to help
ourselves."</p>

<p>"I can't see anything comforting in that proposition,
either way," observed Dick. "All I hope is, just now,
that Ysabel will be careful, and that Pedro will look
after her. Everything depends on her."</p>

<p>"She's a brick!" murmured Matt admiringly.</p>

<p>"And she's doing all this for you, matey!"</p>

<p>"It's for all of us!" declared Matt.</p>

<p>"Don't you never think it," said Speake. "She's runnin'
a lot o' risks, an' I wouldn't never have thought a
girl could have the grit. But Motor Matt was in danger!
That was enough for her to know."</p>

<p>"I wonder how Carl came out with his serenade?" remarked
Dick. "Ysabel wasn't at the house, and it's a
fair guess that our Dutch raggie got into trouble."</p>

<p>Carl certainly had tumbled into difficulties&mdash;but it was
not because he hadn't found any one at home.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose Carl is thinkin' about <i>us</i>?" said
Speake.</p>

<p>"Our disappearance will bother a good many people,"
answered Matt.</p>

<p>Speake's conscience troubled him.</p>

<p>"I feel like an ornery cur," said he, "over the way
Gaines, an' Clackett, an' me acted! Ye remember how
mad us three was at Cassidy when he got in such a
takin' because Matt was put in charge o' the <i>Grampus</i>?
Well, to my notion, we ain't acted any better than Cassidy
did."</p>

<p>"You ought to feel cut up," reproved Dick. "The
only way you can square yourself, Speake, is by doing a
lot to help recapture the ship."</p>

<p>"Jest give me the chance," answered Speake, his eyes
flashing, "an' I'll show you what I can do."</p>

<p>The boys finished the food, took a drink all around
from the bottle of cold coffee that Ysabel had put in the
basket, and then continued their wait for something to
happen. They felt better physically, even if they were
not more hopeful.</p>

<p>Dick lay back on one of the cots and went to sleep;
Speake pulled his hat down over his eyes and leaned
against the forward bulkhead; Matt, flat on his back on
the other cot, stared upward at the rounded deck, wishing
that he could poke a hole through the steel plates and
so gain freedom for himself and his friends.</p>

<p>Speake dozed a little. Something white, poked
through one of the ventilator holes above his head,
floated downward and landed on his knee. He stared at
it drowsily, then brushed at it mechanically with one
hand. Suddenly he realized that the falling of a scrap
of white paper was rather a peculiar circumstance, and
snatched it off the floor.</p>

<p>"Matt!" he called.</p>

<p>"What is it?" returned Matt, rising on his elbow and
directing his gaze at Speake.</p>

<p>"This dropped down on me!" Speake held up the
paper.</p>

<p>Matt was off the cot in a flash and standing at
Speake's side.</p>

<p>"When?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Jest now."</p>

<p>"It was pushed through one of the ventilator openings.
It's a note&mdash;from Ysabel."</p>

<p>He passed to Dick's side and shook him into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"A note from Ysabel, pushed in to us through one of
the holes in the forward bulkhead."</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me!" muttered Dick, smothering his excitement.
"Read it, matey! Perhaps she's captured the
revolvers."</p>

<p>The note was written in pencil on a ragged scrap of
paper. Matt, in a guarded voice, read it aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Pedro is asleep at the door. Fingal has gone off on
the river bank. The two others are playing cards on the
deck. I have Pedro's revolver and have unlocked the
door. Now is the time! Capture Pedro and tie him&mdash;but
don't hurt him. Be quiet&mdash;if he makes an outcry all
is lost. Hurry!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Speake pulled off his coat.</p>

<p>"This is bully!" he whispered. "Now we've got a
chance."</p>

<p>"It's an opportunity I wasn't expecting," said Matt,
pulling off his shoes carefully. "In our stocking feet,
fellows! We must not make any noise. While Speake
and I are binding Pedro, Dick, you go down and let
Gaines and Clackett out of the torpedo room. If we
work this right we may be able to get away from here
and down the river."</p>

<p>All three of the prisoners were excited, as well they
might be. An opportunity offered to save themselves
and the boat&mdash;success or failure hanging on their quickness
and silence.</p>

<p>Advancing to the door, Matt laid his hand on the
knob. Slowly he twisted the catch out of its socket, and
then inch by inch forced the door open.</p>

<p>Yet, slight though the noise was that accompanied the
click of the catch, Pedro heard it. With a startled exclamation
he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>Matt and Speake sprang at him, Matt catching his
wrists and Speake throwing an arm about his throat
and clapping a hand over his lips.</p>

<p>The odds were against Pedro, and he was helpless;
yet, for all that, he managed to squirm about and make
considerable noise.</p>

<p>There was a drone of voices overhead, coming down
the open hatch. The voices suddenly ceased, and some
one was heard floundering over the deck to the top of
the tower.</p>

<p>The electric light was not burning in the periscope
room, and the only light that entered the chamber came
from the hatch. Any one looking downward would not
have been able to see anything distinctly except in the
immediate vicinity of the bottom of the ladder. Matt,
Speake and Pedro, as it chanced, were close to the locker.</p>

<p>"Anythin' wrong down there, greaser!" called a husky
voice.</p>

<p>"No, señor," answered Matt, trying to imitate the
rough voice of the Mexican.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thought I heard you movin' around," said the man
above, turning away from the top of the tower.</p>

<p>Pedro was forced down on the locker, and Ysabel
glided forward with a piece of rope for bonds and a
piece of cloth for a gag. Pedro turned his wild eyes
on the girl with startled inquiry and suspicion.</p>

<p>"You will not be hurt, Pedro!" whispered the girl;
"don't make a noise&mdash;please."</p>

<p>She followed this with some soft words in Spanish.
But Pedro, loyal though he undoubtedly was to the
girl, continued to struggle. Matt and Speake, however,
managed to get him bound and gagged.</p>

<p>"This is only the beginning, Motor Matt," breathed
Ysabel, her cheeks flushed with excitement and her eyes
bright as stars. "Here is Pedro's revolver&mdash;take it."</p>

<p>Matt took the weapon and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"We can't use firearms," he whispered, "for they
make too much noise. Our hope lies in capturing our
enemies one at a time, then cutting the cables and dropping
down the river. If possible, we must do this before
Fingal gets back."</p>

<p>"Where did Dick go?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"To release Gaines and Clackett. The torpedo-room
door is fastened by a bolt on the outside, so he'll have no
trouble in getting them out. We'll wait till they come
before making our next move."</p>

<p>Matt had hardly finished speaking before Dick came
in through the forward door of the room. Clackett
followed him&mdash;but Gaines was not along.</p>

<p>Matt lifted a warning finger as Dick was about to
speak, pointed upward toward the deck and then motioned
for Dick and Clackett to come closer.</p>

<p>"Where is Gaines?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"He got out through the torpedo tube, half an hour
ago," said Dick.</p>

<p>Matt, as will be remembered, had already thought of
this maneuvre. But it was unfortunate that Gaines had
put it into effect, in view of what was transpiring.</p>

<p>"What was Gaines going to do?" asked Matt, of
Clackett.</p>

<p>"He reckoned he'd go up the river an' try an' find
General Mendez," replied Clackett. "We sort o figgered
it out between us that some of the soldiers under
Mendez could come here and capture the boat and release
the rest of us."</p>

<p>Here was an awkward situation, and Matt wrinkled
his brows over it.</p>

<p>They could not leave without Gaines. He was taking
chances and doing his best to be of service to his comrades,
and dropping down the river without him was not
to be thought of.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now, matey?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"Keep on with our plan," answered Matt. "There are
two of the scoundrels playing cards on deck. We must
get them as safely as we have got Pedro."</p>

<p>"Shall we make a racket and bring them down?"</p>

<p>"They'll both come, if we do that. We can capture
them with less noise if they come one at a time."</p>

<p>Ysabel started forward.</p>

<p>"I'll go up the ladder," said she, "and say that Pedro
wants one of them. After you capture him, I'll go up
after the other."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Matt. "Get ropes, boys," he added
to the others, "and stand ready for some swift and noiseless
work."</p>

<p>Ysabel glided to the ladder. Before she could mount,
however, some one was heard climbing over the top of
the conning tower. As those below looked upward, a
pair of booted feet swung down.</p>

<p>"Fingal!" gasped Ysabel, drawing away fearfully.</p>

<p>Matt motioned her out of the room.</p>

<p>"Stand ready for him," he whispered, "as he reaches
the bottom of the ladder. The smallest mistake now
means failure. Ready!"</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, Matt, Dick, Speake and Clackett
stood waiting for the burly ruffian who, jointly with
Don Carlos, was responsible for all their troubles.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">EXCITING WORK.</p>


<p>Fingal was a big fellow, and Matt remembered with
a shudder the crushing embrace of his huge arms at the
time the crew of the submarine were routed. But Matt,
with so many to help him, was not worrying over the
outcome. What caused him the most concern was the
thought that, in spite of their precautions, there would
be noise enough to alarm the two men who were playing
cards.</p>

<p>Fingal came down the ladder slowly. Fortunately for
those below he kept his gaze upward as he descended.
When he reached the foot of the ladder his face was
toward the after bulkhead of the periscope room, and
those who were waiting were behind.</p>

<p>At a signal from Matt the attack was made. Matt
himself sprang at Fingal's throat and caught his bull-like
neck in a strangling grip. Like a huge animal, Fingal
pushed himself around. Speake had one of his arms
and Dick the other. Clackett, bending down, caught his
feet and jerked them off the floor.</p>

<p>Fighting furiously, Fingal was thus thrown bodily
into the hands and arms of Matt, Dick and Speake.
They were not expecting to receive the heavy weight,
and the huge body crashed to the floor. Matt's grip
about Fingal's throat was wrenched loose, and a half-strangled
bellow of fury went up from the desperate
scoundrel.</p>

<p>Feet stamped the deck. There was no need of a demand
from those above as to what was going on, for both
the men knew that there was trouble. Fingal would not
have bellowed in that fashion if there had not been.</p>

<p>"Never mind the noise, now," panted Matt. "We're in
for it, and we must be quick."</p>

<p>One of the other men already had his feet on the ladder.
Leaving Dick, Speake and Clackett to handle Fingal,
Matt jumped up the ladder, caught the descending
feet and flung his whole weight on them.</p>

<p>As a result, the man's hands were torn from the iron
rungs, and he and Matt tumbled in a heap on the floor
of the periscope room.</p>

<p>Matt came off better than his antagonist, for the latter
struck his head against the steering wheel, doubled himself
up in a ball, then flung out his limbs convulsively
and lay silent and still.</p>

<p>"Look after both of them, fellows!" cried Matt. "I'm
going after the other one."</p>

<p>The second of the two men who had been on the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was showing more wariness than his companion had
done. The abrupt disappearance of his comrade from
the top of the ladder had filled him with doubts, and
when he saw Matt rushing upward, he must have gained
the idea that all the others were captured. Yet, be that
as it may, he whirled from the conning tower in a panic
and leaped off the boat.</p>

<p>When Matt lifted his head clear of the hatch, a sharp
report echoed out, and a bullet struck the sloping side
of the conning tower and glanced harmlessly off into the
river.</p>

<p>The ruffian was standing on the planks that had formed
the old landing. Undeterred by the shot, Matt threw
himself out of the tower, gained the rickety wharf at a
jump, and raced after the man.</p>

<p>The latter retreated to the bank, turned there, and essayed
another shot. A metallic click echoed out, but
no report. Again and again the trigger fell uselessly.</p>

<p>With an oath, the fellow hurled the weapon at Matt,
faced about, and dashed into the timber.</p>

<p>Matt gave pursuit. Had it not been that Gaines was
missing from the boat's complement, Matt would not
have chased the fugitive; but Gaines' absence made it
necessary for the submarine to remain at the landing
until he should return, and if this man got away he
would probably spread the news of what had happened
and cause a detachment of the revolutionists to charge
the boat.</p>

<p>Matt, it will be remembered, was in his stocking feet.
The ground over which he was running was covered
with sharp stones, and before he had gone a hundred
yards he realized that he would have to give up the
pursuit.</p>

<p>Turning back, he regained the landing, leaped to the
deck of the submarine and bent over the hatch.</p>

<p>"How are you, down there?" he called.</p>

<p>"Finer'n silk!" came the jubilant voice of Speake.
"We've got lashings on both men. Where's the other
chap?"</p>

<p>"He jumped ashore and got away. Come up here,
Dick, you and Clackett. One of you bring a hatchet. Let
Ysabel watch the prisoners, and you, Speake, go below
and see if everything is in shape for a quick departure."</p>

<p>"Goin' to leave without Gaines, Matt?" asked Clackett.</p>

<p>"Not unless we have to. We're going to hang out here
until the last moment."</p>

<p>Dick and Clackett presently showed themselves on
deck. Matt had already discovered that the <i>Grampus</i>
was moored to two trees with a couple of cables at the
bow and stern. The boat was pointed upstream.</p>

<p>"Cast off the stern cable, Clackett," ordered Matt, "and
throw it aboard. One rope is enough to hold us. Go
out on the bow, Dick," he added, "and sit there with the
hatchet. If you get an order to cut the cable, don't lose
any time in carrying it out."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, matey," replied Dick.</p>

<p>Clackett went ashore and unfastened the rear cable
from the tree. Matt drew it in, coiled it, and dropped it
down the hatch.</p>

<p>"What am I to do now, Matt?" shouted Clackett.</p>

<p>"Go up the bank and a little way into the woods," answered
Matt; "hide yourself and watch for soldiers. If
you hear or see any, rush this way and give the alarm to
Dick. He'll cut the cable, and then the two of you dodge
below as quick as the nation will let you, the last one
down closing the hatch after him. Understand?"</p>

<p>"That's plain enough," said Clackett, climbing the
bank and vanishing in the timber.</p>

<p>Matt went down into the periscope room and found
Ysabel sitting on one of the stools and keeping watch
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>Fingal, his great arms twisting fiercely against the
ropes and his eyes glaring, lay on the floor. Near him
was the other prisoner. The latter had recovered from
the blow that had stunned him, and, to judge from his
humble appearance, his war-like disposition was entirely
gone.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with Pedro, Matt?" asked Ysabel
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Does he want to go back with us to Belize? Ask
him."</p>

<p>"If he did that, they would probably arrest him for
what he has done," said the girl.</p>

<p>She put the question, however, and Pedro shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Ask him if he wants us to put him ashore here."</p>

<p>Pedro nodded as soon as Ysabel had translated the
words into Spanish.</p>

<p>"Tell him we'll do that before we leave," said Matt,
"but that we can't trust him ashore until we are ready
to go."</p>

<p>Pedro tried to talk in response to this, and Matt removed
the gag for a moment. Turning his face toward
Ysabel, Pedro spoke rapidly for a few moments. Ysabel's
face became very serious as she listened.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"He says that the <i>Grampus</i> will never be able to leave
the river," answered the girl; "that the fort is in the
hands of the rebels and that they are planting mines in
the river, so close to the bottom that the submarine will
strike them if she submerges. If she floats on the surface,
then the guns of the fort will sink her."</p>

<p>There was terror in the girl's face as she repeated
Pedro's words.</p>

<p>Here was an unlooked-for difficulty, and one that gave
Matt the utmost concern.</p>

<p>"Just ask him, Ysabel," said he, "why the rebels
planted mines in the river when they knew the submarine
was in the hands of their friends? Pedro's story
sounds improbable, to me. If it comes to that, we passed
the mouth of the river under water, and no one in the
fort or the town saw us."</p>

<p>Ysabel talked for a few moments more with Pedro.</p>

<p>"He says," the girl reported finally, "that Don Carlos
saw the flag of the rebels flying from the fort by means
of the periscope when we ascended the stream; that the
don knew there were some submarine mines in Port Livingston,
and that he was going to have the soldiers plant
them. He was afraid Fingal might try to run away
with the <i>Grampus</i>, and intended to pen her in the river."</p>

<p>"Then even these revolutionists can't trust each other!"
exclaimed Matt. "With such a lack of confidence as
that, if it extends to the rank and file, the insurrection
will prove a farce. Just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment some one landed heavily on the deck
of the submarine. Matt straightened erect and stepped
to the foot of the ladder. Looking up, he saw Clackett
gazing down.</p>

<p>"There are two men comin', Matt!" reported Clackett.
"One of 'em's Don Carlos, an' the other wears a red coat
with shoulder straps and has a sword."</p>

<p>"Some officer, I suppose," said Matt. "Come down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
here, quick, Clackett, and tell Dick to follow you, but not
to cut the cable. Speake!" he called through one of the
tubes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" came back the voice of Speake.</p>

<p>"Up here with you! More work."</p>

<p>Speake, tumbling up from below, and Dick and
Clackett, dropping down from above, reached the periscope
room at about the same time. Matt had been replacing
the gag between Pedro's lips.</p>

<p>"Drag the prisoners into the room where they were
keeping us," said Matt. "There's going to be more lively
work here, and we've got to clear decks for action."</p>

<p>While Speake, Clackett and Dick fell to with a will,
half dragging and half carrying the prisoners into the
steel chamber off the periscope room, Matt kept close to
the periscope and watched the bank above the landing.</p>

<p>Then, just as his comrades finished their work, and
returned to his side, he gave vent to an exclamation and
whirled away from the periscope table.</p>

<p>"Don Carlos is coming," he whispered, "and General
Pitou is with him! Now, at one stroke, we can lay the
rebel general by the heels and nip this revolution in the
bud. Steady, now! Not a whisper, mind. There are
two of them, and we must capture them both."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CAPTURING THE GENERAL.</p>


<p>Matt, on the occasion of his former visit to the River
Izaral, had caught a fleeting glimpse of General Pitou.
Speake, who had been a prisoner in the general's hands
for a brief time, was more familiar with his appearance.
Gliding to the periscope table, Speake took a look for
himself.</p>

<p>"You're right, Matt," he whispered, "it's the old villain
himself."</p>

<p>"I should think he was takin' chances coming so far
from camp," remarked Clackett, "and right in the direction
of General Mendez and his troops."</p>

<p>"Mayhap," chuckled Dick, "he was expecting to drop
down the river in the submarine. Let's not disappoint
him, mates. He'll go down, but not with the people he
intended to have as companions."</p>

<p>"Hist!" warned Matt.</p>

<p>A deep silence reigned in the periscope room. Voices
were heard on the landing, and then a clattering rattle
as the general landed on the deck. Don Carlos followed
more lightly, and stepped to the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Fingal!" called Don Carlos. "The general is here,
and he feels that the prisoners must be dealt with in a
summary manner at once. He doesn't think it advisable
to wait until nightfall. Better bring them up."</p>

<p>Here, in a moment, a situation was developed which
threatened Matt's plan for entrapping Don Carlos and
Pitou. The don and the general were not intending to
come into the boat, but to wait on the deck while the prisoners
were brought up.</p>

<p>"I say, below there!" called Don Carlos, in a louder
voice. "Wake up, you! Where's Fingal?"</p>

<p>"Ahoy, don!" bellowed Matt, trying his utmost to imitate
the raucous tones of Fingal's voice. "Bring the general
down a minute!"</p>

<p>Matt's imitation was fairly good, but not good enough
to deceive the keen ears of Don Carlos.</p>

<p>With a yell of alarm, the don sprang ashore.</p>

<p>"This way, general!" he shouted; "hurry! There's
something wrong here."</p>

<p>There followed a crash, a rattling slide of some object
over the sloping deck of the boat, then a shrill "<i>Pardieu!
Sacre, sacr-r-r-e tonnerre!</i>"</p>

<p>Matt rushed up the ladder and looked out of the
hatch.</p>

<p>The general was a little man, and he carried a prodigious
sword and wore a pair of immense spurs on his
cavalry boots. As near as Matt could judge, from what
he saw, the general had tried to leap ashore and his spurs
had caught in one of the guy ropes. Instead, therefore,
of leaping, he fell in a heap, and had clattered and banged
along the deck until he was caught and held between the
side of the boat and a pile that formed part of the wharf.</p>

<p>The general was seeking in vain to extricate himself
from his difficulties. Every time he tried to get up, his
boots would slip on the rounded plates, and he would
sit down on the sharp points of his spurs.</p>

<p>The air was fairly blue in his immediate vicinity, and
a perfect bedlam of epithets went up from him. Don
Carlos, seeing Matt in the top of the tower, guessed
rightly that the prisoners had released themselves in some
manner. The don did not return to assist the general,
but danced about on the bank, tossing his arms frantically
and shouting for him to make haste.</p>

<p>The general was more than anxious to oblige, but fate
was against anything like haste. The sharp points of his
spurs galled him, and when his spurs ceased from
troubling, his long sword got between his legs and
tripped him.</p>

<p>Matt had abundant time to slide over the top of the
conning tower, grab the general by the collar of his red
coat and pull him erect on the ridge-like spine of the
deck.</p>

<p>With a howl of wrath, Pitou backed up against the
conning tower, drew his sword, threw his left arm over
his face and proceeded savagely to carve slices out of
the air.</p>

<p>The situation was serious, from several points of view,
but Matt, for all that, could hardly repress a laugh.</p>

<p>Then, to crown the ignominy that was being heaped
upon the general, Speake suddenly hoisted himself above
the top of the tower, noted the situation, reached out
calmly and passed his arms about the general's body under
the shoulders.</p>

<p>The next moment Matt had a glimpse of a red coat, a
pair of cavalry boots, and flashing spurs being elevated
and dragged down into the maw of the tower.</p>

<p>It was a tragic disappearance&mdash;tragic for the general&mdash;for,
in this inglorious manner, he was leaving the scene
of his military exploits.</p>

<p>As soon as Matt got below he found his friends enjoying
the general as much as he had done. Clackett had
taken his sword, Speake had pulled off his boots, and
Dick was sitting on the captive's breast, pinning him to
the floor while he affixed cords to his wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>"Fer goodness' sake," cried Speake, "get somethin'
between his jaws! He's chatterin' more'n a cage o'
monkeys."</p>

<p>Ysabel stepped forward with a bandage, and the general
was soon silent. Dick finished by dragging him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the prison chamber and dropping him down beside
Fingal.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fine general it is!" laughed Dick. "And
he was trying to make himself dictator of the country!
I wonder what sort of a population they have here, to let
a little wasp like that go on the warpath and make
trouble!"</p>

<p>"He is a little wretch!" exclaimed Ysabel, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>"And that's the military phenomenon your uncle, Abner
Fingal, was trying to make you marry!" exclaimed Dick,
suddenly recalling a half-forgotten episode in Ysabel's
life.</p>

<p>The girl flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"Never!" she breathed fiercely.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for his spurs and his sword," said
Matt, "he would have been able to get away. But we're
strangely reckless, friends," he added, "to amuse ourselves
with the general when we are in such desperate
plight. We can't leave here until Gaines gets back, and
not only has one of Fingal's men escaped us, but Don
Carlos has likewise got away. Both will carry the news
of what we have done to the camp of the rebels&mdash;and you
can imagine what will happen when the rebels hear that
we have got their general below decks. We'll have the
entire army about our ears&mdash;and that won't do; at least,
not until we have Gaines with us. After that, we can
close the hatch, sink below the surface and glide down-stream
without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt paused. He suddenly remembered what Pedro
had said about the submarine mines at the mouth of the
river.</p>

<p>"What's taken you aback, matey?" spoke up Dick.
"You act as though you had just thought of something."</p>

<p>"We may have a hard time getting out of the river,"
returned Matt. "Pedro told Ysabel that the rebels had
planted mines in the river bed, close to the fort, and that
they were so low in the water we would probably strike
them if we tried to pass the fort submerged. Again, if
we attempt to gain the gulf by keeping on the surface
of the river, the cannon in the fort will bombard us."</p>

<p>"A plague on their mines and their cannon!" cried
Dick recklessly. "We'll run past the fort. If the soldiers
are all as able as their general, they couldn't hit us
with grape and canister."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a bridge for us to cross at a later time,"
said Matt. "Just at present we have Gaines to think
about. He ought to have got back by this time.
Clackett, go back to your post in the woods and keep a
sharp watch for soldiers. We'll surely have a visit from
them now. Up on deck with your hatchet, Dick, and
stand ready to cut the cable at the first sign of an attack."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," responded Dick, picking up the hatchet.
"I think, matey, we could capture the whole rebel army
if it came our way."</p>

<p>"We've had one experience with the rebel army,
Dick," said Matt, "and it was far from pleasant. Let's
not repeat the experience. Climb for the deck, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Events were happening for the young motorist and his
chums that day! They were coming like the rapid reports
of a Gatling gun, and hardly was one issue met and
vanquished before another was raised.</p>

<p>Dick and Clackett were on their way up the ladder
when a rattle of musketry reached the ears of those in
the submarine. It came from the direction of the bank,
and was followed by loud cries and a tremendous thrashing
among the bushes.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" cried Matt. "Don Carlos must have met a
detachment of Pitou's army and have headed them this
way! We can't wait any longer for Gaines! Up with
you and cut the cable!"</p>

<p>Clackett stepped off the ladder to make room for Matt,
who sprang to follow Dick aloft.</p>

<p>When Dick reached the deck, he gave a shout of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Lively, matey!" he called.</p>

<p>When Matt was able to see what was going on, he
was as greatly surprised as Dick had been.</p>

<p>Coming down the bank, and traveling as fast as his
long legs could carry him, was Gaines. He was clad only
in shirt and trousers, and his bare feet were bleeding
from their contact with the sharp stones. Unmindful of
this trying discomfort, he rushed down the bank with
flying leaps, while bushes crackled behind him and little
wreaths of smoke rose upward, marking the discharge
of firearms.</p>

<p>Matt rushed along the deck and caught the hatchet out
of his chum's hand.</p>

<p>"Go to the engine room, Dick," said he quickly, "and
take charge of the motor. Send Clackett to the tank
room. Let Speake take the wheel until I come. Submerge
when I give the word, and do it <i>quick</i>!"</p>

<p>It was no time for hesitation, and Ferral darted back
down the hatch.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">OFF FOR THE GULF.</p>


<p>It was easily seen that Gaines was nearly spent. His
breath tore through his lips in gasps, and when he reached
the edge of the wharf, he fell there, unable to roll over
the edge and drop down on the deck of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>Out of the bushes at the top of the bank came the foremost
of the pursuing soldiers. Fortunately for Matt and
Gaines, they were armed with muzzle-loaders, and were
frantically getting another charge into the barrels.</p>

<p>Dropping the hatchet, Matt leaped to the wharf, caught
Gaines and pulled him down on the deck; then, springing
back, he picked up the hatchet and severed the cable with
a blow.</p>

<p>The bow of the submarine caught the current, swung
farther out into the stream, then whirled around and
started away. This placed the conning tower between
Matt and Gaines, and several bullets hit the tower and
glanced singing into the air.</p>

<p>"You're all right, Gaines," said Matt, bending over the
motorist. "You got out of that fix&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the skin of my teeth!" panted Gaines. "Oh, what
a run! I never ran so fast, and so far, and over so many
stones and briers, before in my life. I thought, a dozen
times, they had me."</p>

<p>"Hard luck that you should have run into the rebels
when you were looking for the soldiers of General
Mendez."</p>

<p>"Rebels?" cried Gaines. "Why, Matt, those fellows
weren't rebels. They were the loyalist soldiers!"</p>

<p>"The troops of General Mendez?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," queried Matt angrily, "why were they chasing
you, and shooting at you?"</p>

<p>"I give it up. They must have taken me for one of
the rebels&mdash;possibly they thought I was General Pitou."</p>

<p>"They couldn't have thought that," answered Matt.
"The general is only about half your size."</p>

<p>"Clackett told you why I got out through the torpedo
tube?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But how did you ever do it without being seen
by Fingal and his men?"</p>

<p>"I was shot along upstream, and straight into the
bank. Fingal was sitting on the deck at the time, and the
sudden heave of the forward end of the boat drew his
attention, but he didn't see me. As soon as I could I got
up the bank, but the compressed air had made me dizzy
and I was obliged to rest before I could travel. After I
got started I found that I couldn't go fast on account of
my bare feet. I must have been about a mile away before
I saw any soldiers. There was a straggling column of
them, and they appeared to be the vanguard of an advancing
army. They were Mendez's men, and I was
pleased a lot, because I was sure I could get them to go
back with me and help recapture the submarine.</p>

<p>"When I started toward them, though, they began to
shoot and to run toward me. I couldn't stop and explain,
for I wasn't at all sure that my explanation would
be accepted. So all I could do was turn and see how
quick I could get back over the ground. That's about
all, Matt. But how did you get clear? It was a surprise
to see you on the boat. I was expecting to be met by
Fingal and his gang."</p>

<p>"That's too much to tell just now, Gaines. We're all
free, however, and all together once more. We have been
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"What became of Fingal?"</p>

<p>"He's a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Good! Any more prisoners?"</p>

<p>"General Pitou&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"General Pitou!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and one of Fingal's men, and another who is
more a friend of Ysabel Sixty's than he is of Fingal's."</p>

<p>"What about Ysabel Sixty?"</p>

<p>"She's below, too."</p>

<p>"Where did she come from?"</p>

<p>"She was one of those we took out of that yawl. We
all thought she was a boy until she told us who she was.
We owe our escape to her."</p>

<p>While sitting on the deck, Gaines had been slowly recovering
his strength. He was still muttering dazedly
over Matt's amazing disclosures, when Speake showed
himself at the hatch.</p>

<p>"You fellows better come below!" he called. "Dick
said you wanted the boat submerged, Matt, an' I guess
that the quicker we do it the better. There's an outfit of
black soldiers, dead ahead, waiting for us."</p>

<p>Matt whirled around and allowed his eyes to follow the
direction of Speake's pointing finger.</p>

<p>On a shelf-like projection of the high bank, perhaps a
quarter of a mile ahead, was a group of rebels. They
could be seen only indistinctly, but it was apparent from
their actions that they were waiting for the <i>Grampus</i> to
come within good range.</p>

<p>"Climb for the hatch, Gaines!" ordered Matt. "We've
got to get below the surface. If we stay out here, while
we're passing those soldiers, they'll shoot us off the
deck."</p>

<p>Gaines got to his feet and walked painfully to the
tower. After he had climbed in, and vanished, Matt
followed, closing the hatch behind him.</p>

<p>"Fill the ballast tanks, Clackett!" called Matt, through
the tank-room tube. "About ten feet will do, just so the
periscope ball is awash."</p>

<p>A moment more and the submarine began to settle
downward.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do when we get near the fort,
Matt?" asked Speake.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the rebels have had time to plant any
submarine mines," said Matt. "It takes some time to do
that, and not enough time has elapsed since Don Carlos
reached the fort and reported that the submarine had
been captured. We'll pass the fort under water, and
chance the mines. Better that than running on the surface
and being bombarded."</p>

<p>Patter, patter came a ringing hail on the deck.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Gaines, "the soldiers are taking a whack
at us!" He laughed derisively. "I guess we can stand
as much of that as they want to give us. Their lead
slides from the deck like water off a duck's back."</p>

<p>Patter, patter&mdash;<i>smash</i>!</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" cried Matt. "What was that?
Something broke."</p>

<p>"The periscope ball!" gasped Speake. "They've put
the periscope out of commission. Empty the tanks!" he
yelled into the tank-room tube.</p>

<p>The periscope table reflected nothing of the treacherous
channel along which the current and the propeller
were carrying the <i>Grampus</i> at a terrific pace.</p>

<p>It was necessary to come to the surface as quickly as
possible and use the conning-tower lunettes.</p>

<p>"Reverse your engine, Dick!" cried Matt to the motor
room. "Full speed astern!"</p>

<p>The engine was instantly reversed, but not until the
submarine had run into some obstruction, halting her with
a jar that threw all her passengers off their feet.</p>

<p>For a moment the silence was broken only by the hum
of the fiercely working cylinders, and the splash and
bubble of the current as it met the obstruction of the huge
steel shell.</p>

<p>"Cut out the turbines!" yelled Matt; "empty the tanks
by compressed air. Full speed astern, Dick! Every ounce
of power now!"</p>

<p>"What's happened, do you think, Matt?"</p>

<p>The question came from Ysabel. She had been sitting
on the locker in the periscope room, watching eagerly all
that had taken place.</p>

<p>"The river winds about a good deal, Ysabel," Matt answered,
"and we have probably run into the bank. When
the periscope went out of commission it prevented us
from keeping track of our course. Ah!" he added, noticing
that the propeller was dragging them against the current
and away from the bank, and that they were rising
toward the surface. "We'll do, now."</p>

<p>"But we can't pass them cannon on the surface," observed
Speake.</p>

<p>"There's nothing else for it, Speake," answered Matt,
"but a dash straight for the gulf. We'll have to keep to
the surface, and if the rebels are able to aim straight,
they're going to give us a lively time."</p>

<p>Matt relieved Speake in the conning tower. With his
eyes against the lunettes, the king of the motor boys
kept keen watch ahead as turn after turn of the river
unfolded before the racing boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>At last they came close to a bend on the opposite side
of which Matt knew there was a straightway stretch of
water leading to the gulf.</p>

<p>He signaled the motor room for full speed astern once
more, then slowed down until the backward pull of the
propeller just balanced the rush of the current, the
<i>Grampus</i> hanging stationary in mid-stream.</p>

<p>"Gaines," called Matt, "are you well enough to take
the engine? I want Dick up here with me."</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Gaines.</p>

<p>"Then go down and send him up."</p>

<p>Dick reached the periscope room in a few moments.</p>

<p>"Dick," said Matt, "our periscope is out of commission
and we've got to pass the fort on the surface of the
river. We could wait until night. That would give the
rebels less of a chance at us, but it would also make our
dash for the gulf a good deal more dangerous. The
daylight has advantages as well as disadvantages, and so
has the night. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I'm for running their bally old fort," answered Dick.
"We'll go so fast they can't hit us."</p>

<p>"Get the Stars and Stripes out of the locker, Dick,"
said Matt. "We'll haul it up to the staff as we pass and
see if it commands their respect."</p>

<p>Matt threw open the conning-tower hatch. The next
moment, with his body half exposed above the hatch, he
rang for full speed ahead.</p>

<p>As the <i>Grampus</i> started on the last leg of her dangerous
voyage, Dick forced his way up beside his chum.</p>

<p>"Give me room, old ship," said he, between his teeth.
"I'm going out on deck. If the flag commands any respect,
it will be under my personal supervision."</p>

<p>"Run up the flag and then get back below," answered
Matt, squeezing to one side of the tower so that Dick
could pass.</p>

<p>Dick had kicked off his shoes and thrown aside his
hat. Stripped for action, he bent the flag to the halyards
as the submarine swept onward toward the threatening
wall of the fort.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">RUNNING THE BATTERY.</p>


<p>Signs of activity showed around the fort as the
<i>Grampus</i> rushed down toward it. Soldiers with rifles
appeared on the walls, and the muzzles of the cannon
were being slowly depressed in order to get the boat under
a drop fire.</p>

<p>"They're going to let us have it&mdash;hot blocks, matey!"
called Ferral, still working with the flag.</p>

<p>"Get the bunting up and return below!" ordered Matt.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think, matey, that you're the only one
who's privileged to show himself while the rebels are
shaking out their loads at us."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to expose yourself to needless danger,
Dick," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Danger!" Dick gave vent to a scornful laugh. "I
don't think the greasers can shoot. Let's give 'em a
chance at us and see if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick was interrupted by a hoarse boom!</p>

<p>Four cannon commanded the river side of the fort,
and four the bay side. It was one of the guns on the
river side that had spoken. A round shot plunged into
the water on the port side of the boat, sending a jet of
spray high into the air.</p>

<p>"I told you so!" yelled Dick, and shook his fist at the
fort.</p>

<p>As he looked upward he saw three soldiers on the wall
getting ready to shoot.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>Two more cannon were fired, almost at the same time.
The solid shot plunged into the water altogether too close
to the boat for comfort.</p>

<p>"Up with the colors, Dick!" shouted Motor Matt;
"let's see if they dare fire on that flag!"</p>

<p>Dick hauled up the flag. As the gay little banner
caught the breeze and opened out, a crack of rifles was
heard from the fort.</p>

<p>The flag fluttered sharply.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that!" roared Dick, once more
shaking his fist upward in the direction of the fort;
"they've put a hole through the flag. Oh, strike me
lucky! If it was the British flag they treated like that, an
army would march through the country before the scoundrels
were a month older."</p>

<p>"They're an irresponsible lot, anyhow," said Matt.
"Besides, we've got General Pitou below, and General
Mendez will have an easy time of it when he gets here
with his army. The uprising is as good as squelched.
If anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A perfect roar of guns echoed from the hill. With a
crash the periscope mast went by the board, and the
round shot caused the water to bubble and boil all around
the submarine.</p>

<p>"They've got a grouch against that periscope, old ship!"
laughed Dick.</p>

<p>"We'll have to have a new mast and ball as soon as
we get back to Belize," said Matt.</p>

<p>Just then he guided the <i>Grampus</i> in a wide sweep
around the headland to the left of the river mouth.</p>

<p>"A moment more," said Dick, "and we'll have the town
between us and the fort. They're slow at loading those
old carronades. Never saw so many butter fingers!
Those fellows' hands must be all thumbs. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick did not finish his sarcastic remarks. Just then
there was a tremendous explosion just behind the submarine.
A column of water arose high in the air and,
descending in a huge wave, carried the stern of the boat
under and threw the bow high in the air. The water all
around was a veritable caldron.</p>

<p>Frantic cries came from within the hull. Matt, owing
to the almost vertical inclination of the steel hull, was
hurled out of the conning tower and came into violent
collision with Dick, who was clinging with a life-and-death
grip to the flagstaff guys.</p>

<p>For a second the <i>Grampus</i> heaved and tossed on the
troubled waves, then righted herself buoyantly and drove
ahead.</p>

<p>Matt picked himself up and climbed hastily back into
the conning tower. He was sore and bruised, but he
realized that he could not leave the submarine to steer
herself.</p>

<p>"What was that, old ship?" cried Dick, rising to his
knees and lifting a pale face upward.</p>

<p>"It must have been a submarine mine," answered Matt,
in a voice that shivered perceptibly.</p>

<p>"A mine!" returned Dick. "But it exploded <i>behind</i>
us! If we set it off, why didn't it explode under us and
blow us to smithereens?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must have been a mine of the floating variety&mdash;a
contact mine which was out of working order. We
passed over it; and then, when we were safely out of
the way, the pesky thing let go."</p>

<p>Dick Ferral's face grew even paler than it had been.
As the dread import of Matt's words dawned on him,
he realized the close call the submarine and all her passengers
had had.</p>

<p>"Dowse me!" Dick muttered, getting slowly to his feet
and rubbing his head, "I never want to get so close to
kingdom come as that again! Why, Matt, we couldn't
have done that trick once in a thousand times."</p>

<p>"We did it this time, anyhow," answered Matt quietly.
"A miss is as good as a mile, Dick. Better go below
and explain to our friends."</p>

<p>Dick staggered back and climbed into the tower, and
his face was still white as he dropped off the ladder into
the periscope room.</p>

<p>Clackett, Speake and Ysabel crowded around him.</p>

<p>"What happened?" cried Clackett. "The old catamaran
turned a regular handspring; then she stood on her
propeller for about a minute and seemed to be thinking
of going down to stay."</p>

<p>Dick explained in a low voice what had happened, sitting
on the locker and almost overcome by the narrow
escape of the boat and her living cargo.</p>

<p>Speake began to shake; Clackett rubbed a dazed hand
across his eyes; and Ysabel, dropping on one of the low
seats, buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Matt!" she gasped, looking up; "how can he stay up
there in the conning tower after such a hairbreadth
escape as that?"</p>

<p>"Matt?" returned Dick. "Why, he's as calm as a day
in June. He's not even ruffled. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" called Clackett. "Matt's saying something."</p>

<p>"Speake!" came the voice from the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," answered Speake.</p>

<p>"Get to work on your electric stove, providing it
wasn't smashed by that somersault we turned, and see if
we can't have a piping-hot meal. Ysabel will help you."</p>

<p>"That's what he's thinking of," muttered Dick, "something
to eat. Well, my old raggie has got more nerve
than I have."</p>

<p>While Speake and Ysabel were getting supper ready,
Dick and Clackett went into the prison room and looked
at the men confined there.</p>

<p>They were all lying in an indiscriminate heap near the
after bulkhead.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of wild gurgling behind the gags,
and Dick and Clackett set to work and laid the prisoners
around the room in something like order. The overturned
cots were placed upright, and Pedro was laid on
one, and the unknown member of Fingal's gang was
placed on the other. Fingal and the general were left
lying on the hard floor.</p>

<p>"The general," remarked Clackett, poking him in the
ribs with the toe of his boot, "was goin' to take care o'
us in a summary fashion. He couldn't hardly wait till
nightfall, the general couldn't. Ain't he a nice-lookin'
specimen, Dick?"</p>

<p>"He's the worst-looking swab I ever saw!" averred
Dick. "He was all sword and spurs, and he didn't know
how to use 'em. That's the reason he got captured. I
guess he'll be hung, fair enough. He ought to be hung,
anyhow, and he would have been if he had fallen into the
hands of General Mendez. We ought to have put him
ashore to take the place of Gaines. We robbed the soldiers
of one victim, and we should have given them another."</p>

<p>"I tell ye what we ought to have done," averred
Clackett.</p>

<p>"Out with it, mate."</p>

<p>"We ought to have laid all these here prisoners out on
the deck when we was passing that fort."</p>

<p>"Sink me," cried Dick, "but that was a bright idea.
But," and Dick's face fell, "like a good many bright ideas
it came too late."</p>

<p>"With them fellers on the deck," said Clackett, waxing
eloquent over his afterthought, "I'll bet somethin' handsome
we could have run past that fort and never been
fired at once."</p>

<p>"Like enough. But we're past the fort, and we're
right side up with care, and we've got Motor Matt to
thank for it all. Let's go back and see how near it is to
supper time."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE "SEMINOLE."</p>


<p>All night long the <i>Grampus</i> felt her way up the coast.
Clackett acted as pilot some of the time, and Matt
"spelled" him in two-hour watches. Neither was very
well acquainted with the coast, and it was necessary to
proceed slowly.</p>

<p>The electric projector was turned against the forward
lunettes, and, with this trail of light stretching before
them, the <i>Grampus</i> plowed her way through the breaking
seas and safely escaped the reefs that lined her course.</p>

<p>Morning found the submarine still several hours from
Belize.</p>

<p>Ysabel and Speake got breakfast, and while it was being
eaten a cry of "Sail, ho!" came from Clackett, who
was in the tower.</p>

<p>"Where away?" called Matt, only passively interested.</p>

<p>"Dead ahead," answered Clackett. "But I ought to
have said 'Smoke, ho!' as the craft is a steamer."</p>

<p>"Which way is she heading?"</p>

<p>"Toward us."</p>

<p>"Then probably she's some Costa Rica fruiter."</p>

<p>Matt went on with his eating. Dick was below, standing
his trick at the motor in order to give Gaines a chance
to eat and rest.</p>

<p>"We're going back to Belize," said Gaines humbly,
"and I feel like a criminal, caught and carried back to
jail."</p>

<p>"Why so?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, because Speake, Clackett and I got the
<i>Grampus</i> into that mess of trouble. She's had more narrow
escapes this trip than she ever had since she was
launched&mdash;and when we listened to the don you'd have
thought we were off on a little pleasure excursion."</p>

<p>"I feel mighty tough myself," put in Speake.</p>

<p>"So do I," cried Clackett from the conning tower.</p>

<p>A little of the conversation had drifted up to him&mdash;enough
so that he could catch the prevailing sentiment of
the remarks.</p>

<p>"Don't fret about what you can't help, men," said Matt.</p>

<p>"But what will Cap'n Nemo, Jr., say?" said Gaines.</p>

<p>"Why, you said he'd be glad we went, after we came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
back and reported," said Speake. "Have ye changed yer
mind, Gaines?"</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind a good many times since we
set off on this cruise," replied Gaines.</p>

<p>"I don't believe the captain will find any fault with
you," said Matt. "I'll do what I can to smooth the thing
over."</p>

<p>"It's like you to do that," returned Gaines gratefully.
"You were the same with Cassidy, that other time when
he came in from the River Izaral, and I remember I
thought you were rather too easy on him."</p>

<p>"We all thought that," said Speake. "And I'm free
to say that I think Matt's too easy on us."</p>

<p>"That bag with the gold pieces was left down in the
torpedo room," went on Clackett.</p>

<p>"It was?" queried Matt, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Yes. I left it there. I wouldn't have touched it with
a ten-foot pole."</p>

<p>"That will pay for a new periscope ball and mast,"
said Matt, "and for the provisions and gasoline we used
up on this trip. Taking it all together, we've had a very
successful cruise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hot and lively," put in Speake.</p>

<p>"And short," added Gaines; "that's the best part of it.
If it had kept up much longer, I'd have been down with
heart failure. We not only had a close call in the matter
of losing the ship to Fingal and his gang, but likewise
in the matter of that submarine mine. My nerves are in
rags, and I hope Nemo, Jr., isn't going to sit down on us
too hard. That would be about the last straw!"</p>

<p>"Hard lines that we couldn't have nabbed Don Carlos,"
wailed Speake. "I'd have taken particular pleasure in
herding him with the rest of our prisoners."</p>

<p>"We've got Pitou," said Matt, "and he's of more importance.
There&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, down there!" came from Clackett.</p>

<p>"What now, Clackett?" sang out Matt.</p>

<p>"That steamer's a warship&mdash;I've just been able to make
her out. By jing, I believe she's the <i>Seminole</i>!"</p>

<p>The announcement aroused a commotion.</p>

<p>"Make way for us to get out on deck, Clackett!" called
Matt. "If she's the <i>Seminole</i>, I want to speak her."</p>

<p>Matt, Speake, Clackett and Ysabel clustered on the
forward deck near the conning tower.</p>

<p>"Get the code book and the signal flags and the binoculars,"
cried Matt. "She's got signals going up at her
gaff and wants to talk to us."</p>

<p>Speake went below for the required articles and, after
fifteen minutes of study and work, Matt and his friends
learned, to their surprise, that the <i>Seminole</i> had put in
at Belize the day before and had been sent by the American
consul to find the submarine. There was so much to
be said that signal flags could not convey that the cruiser
hove to and had the <i>Grampus</i> come around under her lee.</p>

<p>In this manner the submarine was able to come quite
close&mdash;so close that Matt and Dick could see their tow-haired
chum on the cruiser's bridge. Carl picked up a
megaphone and hurled the following at his friends:</p>

<p>"Ah, dere, bards! How you vas? You t'ink id vas
some shmardness to run avay from me, eh? Vell, I haf
peen having some hot dimes so vell as you. Dere is anodder
seat oof drouple pesides Bort Lifingston und
der&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just there the captain grabbed the trumpet out of
Carl's hands to do a little talking that amounted to something.</p>

<p>"We've started for the Izaral River to look for you,"
called the captain.</p>

<p>"How did you know where we had gone?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Don Ramon Ortega furnished the clue to the American
consul at Belize."</p>

<p>"Where did Don Ramon get the clue?"</p>

<p>"Your Dutch pard helped&mdash;but he'll tell you about that
later. What's the matter with your periscope?"</p>

<p>"Bombarded by revolutionists."</p>

<p>"Great Scott! Where?"</p>

<p>"Off Port Livingston."</p>

<p>"If those fellows to the south don't capture that little
scoundrel, Pitou, before long, some of the bigger nations
ought to interfere."</p>

<p>"He's captured," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Is that so? I didn't think Mendez would ever do it."</p>

<p>"He didn't. We're the ones!"</p>

<p>"Well, well! How did you manage?"</p>

<p>"The general got tangled up in his spurs, and before he
could get clear we snaked him below decks."</p>

<p>A roar of laughter came through the cruiser's megaphone.</p>

<p>"He's not the only prisoner we've got," went on Matt.
"Fingal is below!"</p>

<p>"Bully! We want him. Perhaps we had better take all
your prisoners, eh?"</p>

<p>"We'd like to get rid of them."</p>

<p>"Well, stay where you are and we'll send a boat."</p>

<p>"You mustn't let Pedro go, Matt!" exclaimed Ysabel.</p>

<p>"That's so," said Matt. "Suppose you go down, little
girl, and set Pedro free. Send him to the torpedo room
and tell him to wait there until the cruiser is gone."</p>

<p>Ysabel vanished into the tower.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cruiser had been clearing away a boat.
When she hove alongside the submarine, Carl Pretzel,
wearing a grin that could have been tied behind his ears,
was sitting in the bow.</p>

<p>"I vill go mit you part oof dis groose, anyvay," he
whooped. "Drow some lines so dot I may come apoard."</p>

<p>A line was thrown and Carl was heaved from the
rocking rowboat to the submarine's deck. He threw his
arms around Matt and almost hugged him over the side
of the <i>Grampus</i>.</p>

<p>"I vas so habby as I don'd know!" he bubbled. "I
t'ought you vas gone for goot, und dot I don'd vas going
to see you some more. Dere iss a lod to dell, I bed you,
und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We haven't time to tell anything just now, Carl," said
Matt. "As soon as we get rid of our prisoners we'll have
a little leisure."</p>

<p>Carl restrained himself, assisted in the work of getting
the prisoners up and transferred, and then watched
while the launch pulled back to the cruiser with its melancholy
load.</p>

<p>"What will you do with Pitou, captain?" called Matt
through his megaphone.</p>

<p>"Turn him over to the government of that country
down there to be punished for running off the American
consul, and for his many other outrages against peaceable
Americans."</p>

<p>"What do you think the government will do with
him?"</p>

<p>"Firing squad at sunrise," was the laconic response.</p>

<p>"What about Fingal?"</p>

<p>"Our country will take care of him. He'll make a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
cellmate for his brother, Jim Sixty. Sorry you didn't
capture Don Carlos Valdez. The governor at Belize
would like to lay hands on him. He made an unprovoked
attack on the Spanish consul, and, if caught, would
do time for it."</p>

<p>By that time the launch had got back to the ship's
side, and Matt, bidding the captain of the cruiser a hearty
good-by, started the <i>Grampus</i> onward toward Belize.</p>

<p>Speake took the wheel for a while, and the three chums
were able to enjoy a quiet little talk together. While
they were at it, the door of the prison room opened and
Ysabel Sixty stepped out. Carl almost fell off his seat.</p>

<p>"Iss dot a shpook vat I see?" he mumbled, staring at
the girl, "oder iss id Miss Sixdy, der peaudiful maiten
vat I know so vell?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Carl," smiled Ysabel.</p>

<p>"Foolishness iss natural mit me&mdash;I vas porn dot vay.
I see somepody on der teck oof der supmarine, ven ve
first come glose, und I t'ought id looked like you in der
face, aber dose poy's clothes make some greadt shanges.
How id vas, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Carl," said Matt, "did you borrow a
guitar from a fellow at the hotel the night the submarine
left Belize?"</p>

<p>Carl proceeded to work up quite a temper.</p>

<p>"You bed you!" he cried, "und vat you t'ink? Dot
feller vas some shkinflinds. He make me pay six tollar
for dot kiddar! Yah, so helup me! Vy, I ged him for
two tollar by any shdore in der Unidet Shdates vat I

pay."</p>

<p>"What happened to the guitar?"</p>

<p>"Vell, I hit some pulltogs mit id ofter der headt, und
dot kiddar vas proke in a lod oof bieces."</p>

<p>"How did you come to smash the guitar like that?"</p>

<p>"A fellar set der tog on me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Pecause I vas singing some songs unter a vinder oof
a house vere I made some misdake. You see," Carl explained,
"I t'ought id vas Miss Sixdy's house, aber I
vasn't far enough down der shdreed und aroundt der gorner.
It vas der house oof a feller vat hat a cross tisposition.
He pour vater on my headt, und set der tog on me,
und I haf plendy oof drouples. Aber oof id hatn't peen
for dot, Matt, I vouldn't haf found der don, und vouldn't
haf learned vat he hat to say."</p>

<p>"Tell us about that, Carl," said Matt.</p>

<p>Thereupon Carl turned loose and told all about his
disastrous serenade, and how he climbed into the premises
of Don Ramon Ortega, found the don bound and gagged
in his sitting room, released him, and then hurried with
him to the hotel to find Matt, and then to the landing,
only to discover that the submarine had left the harbor.</p>

<p>"Afder dot," proceeded Carl, "der gonsul vas der feller
for us. He say dot der <i>Seminole</i> vould be in der harpor
in der morning, und dot he vould haf her go und look for
der supmarine und Modor Matt. Und dot vas vat he

you fellers shpin some yarns und dell me all aboudt
eferyding. I vant id all, py shinks, und mit nodding lefdt
oudt."</p>

<p>Carl got every detail, and by the time the boys were
through straightening the various events out in his mind,
Speake was ringing the motor-room jingler for less speed,
and signaling for anchors.</p>

<p>"Belize!" he called. "We're at our old berth. Cut out
the talk, down there, and make ready to go ashore. Let
Carl and Dick be the anchor watch, Matt, for you know
that Clackett, Gaines and I have business with Captain
Nemo, Jr."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Captain Nemo, Jr., made an astonishing rally during
the night the <i>Grampus</i> was creeping slowly up the shore
of British Honduras. He awoke from a refreshing slumber,
sound of mind and with an optimistic outlook on life
which boded good things for Speake, Gaines and
Clackett.</p>

<p>The doctor, when he called, shook his hand in congratulation.</p>

<p>"You are doing better than I dared to hope, captain,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Can I talk business, doctor?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"As much as you like. Keep on with the same medicine,
Cassidy," the doctor added to the mate; "I don't
think we can improve on that."</p>

<p>As soon as the doctor had gone, Cassidy made a confession
which he had been keeping stored away in his
mind for several days. It was a confession of his treachery
toward Motor Matt and the rest of his mates aboard
the <i>Grampus</i> during the other cruise south to rescue the
American consul.</p>

<p>Cassidy did not spare himself, but told the astonishing
facts fully and in detail.</p>

<p>Captain Nemo, Jr., listened in pained surprise. For
several minutes after Cassidy finished he did not speak.</p>

<p>"If you're going to begin drinking again, Cassidy,"
said the captain, "I suppose we ought to part company."</p>

<p>"I've taken my last drink," declared Cassidy.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And Motor Matt, on his way back from the River
Izaral, put you back in the ship as mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever Motor Matt does is good enough for
me. If you were put there as mate, then you stay
there."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Cassidy, shaking his captain's
hand.</p>

<p>At that moment a rap fell on the door. Cassidy opened
it, and Gaines, Speake, Clackett and Motor Matt walked
into the room.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Matt!" cried Captain Nemo, Jr., his face
brightening wonderfully at sight of the young motorist,
"this is a pleasure, I must say! You've brought the entire
crew of the <i>Grampus</i> with you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not quite all of them," laughed Matt. "Cassidy was
here, taking care of you, and we left Dick and Carl
aboard for an anchor watch."</p>

<p>"You fellows act as though you had something on your
minds," observed the captain, giving the three members
of the crew a curious look.</p>

<p>"That's what we have, sir," answered Gaines. "We
have a confession to make."</p>

<p>"Confession!" muttered the captain. "This seems to
be my morning for hearing confessions. Well, go ahead."</p>

<p>Thereupon Speake, Gaines and Clackett, on their part,
told the captain exactly what had taken place during this
second trip to the River Izaral. Captain Nemo, Jr., was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
dumfounded. Pursing his thin lips, he leaned back in
his chair and watched and listened with the utmost attention.</p>

<p>"So," said he cuttingly, when the recital was done,
"Motor Matt refused to take my boat south, in response
to the request of this scoundrelly don, and you locked
Matt and Dick in the storage room of the submarine and
went off whether they would or no! And you called
Matt out of the room to fix the motor and keep the boat
from going on the reefs; and you picked up a supposedly
shipwrecked crew out of a boat, and the crew turned on
you and captured the <i>Grampus</i>; and, with the aid of Miss
Sixty, Motor Matt and his friends recovered the boat,
captured Fingal, Pitou and some others, and turned them
over to the cruiser <i>Seminole</i>&mdash;all of which would not have
happened had not you, Speake, Gaines and Clackett acted
in an insubordinate and mutinous manner. What had I
ought to do with them, Matt?"</p>

<p>"They behaved finely during the fighting and while we
were running down the river, past the fort," replied Matt,
"so I don't think they should be dealt with very severely,
captain."</p>

<p>"You're too easy with them, Matt! Look at the
trouble they caused you!"</p>

<p>"But see what good luck came out of it, captain. We
captured Pitou and Fingal."</p>

<p>"That isn't the best thing that has come out of it,
Matt," remarked the captain. "The best thing for me is
the fact that this mutinous conduct of Speake, Clackett
and Gaines proves, more than ever, that you are always
to be depended on. You refused to sail away on a wild-goose
chase after listening to a plausible story told by this
rascally don, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I took a good deal of stock in the story at the time
it was told, captain," said Matt.</p>

<p>"That may be; but you didn't let your own desires
override what you conceived to be your duty. There
would have been no merit in your act, for you, if you had
not wanted to go with the don, but yet allowed your idea
of duty to me hold you back. I am much obliged to
you, Speake, Gaines and Clackett, for affording me this
added proof that my confidence in Motor Matt is not
misplaced. But, if I ever hear of any further mutiny on
the <i>Grampus</i>, there will be something happen which none
of you will ever forget.</p>

<p>"The U. S. cruiser <i>Seminole</i> is in the harbor, and I am
positive that her captain bears some news for me of a
very important nature. This may make it necessary for
a call to be made upon the officers and crew of the
<i>Grampus</i> for some further work. I cannot tell yet as to
that. If so it turns out, then your commanding officer
will be Motor Matt. Now leave me, all of you, for I have
both listened and talked too much, and I am beginning
to feel tired. Have the periscope ball and mast repaired,
Matt, as soon as possible, and call and see me to-night."</p>

<p>As Matt left the house and made his way along the
street, he came suddenly upon Ysabel Sixty, again clad
in her feminine clothes and looking like the Ysabel he
used to know of old.</p>

<p>"You did not stay long at home, Ysabel," smiled Matt.</p>

<p>"I couldn't," she answered. "I wanted to find out what
your plans were, and how long you expect to remain in
Belize."</p>

<p>"That's all in doubt, as yet. I am to call on Captain
Nemo, Jr., to-night, and perhaps he will be able to tell
me something about future plans."</p>

<p>"I hope," and there was a tremulous earnestness in
the girl's words, "that you are not going to leave Belize
very soon."</p>

<p>"I should like to stay here a little while, Ysabel, myself,"
said Matt.</p>

<p>Her face brightened.</p>

<p>"And if you are here for a while, you will come often
and see me?"</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, little girl," said Matt, taking
her hand cordially. "I shall never forget this last
experience of yours, and how you undertook an exceedingly
risky venture solely to be of aid to me."</p>

<p>There was a gentleman waiting for a word with Matt,
and Ysabel, with a glad smile, turned away in the direction
of home.</p>

<p>"Señor Motor Matt?" asked the gentleman, who had
been waiting for Ysabel to finish her talk with Matt.</p>

<p>"The same, sir," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"I, my boy, am Don Ramon Ortega, the Spanish consul
in Belize. I wish to beg your pardon for the serious misadventures
into which you were plunged through the unwarranted
use of my name by that unmitigated scoundrel,
Don Carlos Valdez."</p>

<p>"You were not to blame for that, don."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but I feel keenly the trouble which my
name&mdash;always an honorable one&mdash;has caused you. Some
time, when my family return from Mexico, I shall hope to
see you at my home as an honored guest. Will you
come?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, if I am in Belize."</p>

<p>"I thank you, señor," said the don; and then, with a
courtly bow, he passed on.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys hardly knew whether to
laugh or look sober; but when he reflected on how the
rascally Don Carlos had juggled with the Spanish consul's
name, and used it for base purposes, he felt that
perhaps the consul was right in taking the matter so much
to heart.</p>

<p>That evening, Pedro was taken ashore and lodged in
the house of Ysabel's relatives. The next day he took
passage to Cuba, and forever cut himself adrift from
revolutions and the filibusters who foster them.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<p>"I mean to have a jolly time to-morrow, Phil," said Tom
Chester. "I expect it will cost me a cool fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"What are your plans, that require so much expense?"
asked Philip Marden.</p>

<p>"Being New Year's Day, I must make calls on my friends,
you know. I've got about fifty places chalked down for
visits. I mean to go in style, and so, have engaged a carriage
all to myself for the day. That'll cost ten dollars,
and perhaps more. Then in the evening I'm going to give
a little supper to half a dozen friends. Will you be one of
the number?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I have promised to spend the evening with
my aunt and cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll let you off."</p>

<p>"No doubt, but they would be disappointed, and I would
rather not disappoint them. So, with many thanks, I must
decline your kind invitation."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Tom, but he didn't care much really.
The truth was that Philip was a little too sober and sedate
to suit his taste, and the supper was likely to be a convivial
one.</p>

<p>"So Tom is going to spend fifty dollars in pleasure,"
thought Philip. "Well, he can afford it for once, so far as
money goes, and so can I. I will do it, too, only it may be
that our ideas of pleasure will differ somewhat. I shall
have a few calls to make also."</p>

<p>The next morning Tom set out on his tour of calls. He
had a "jolly" time, as he expected, and drank wine at so
many different places that his head got a little confused by
the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock Philip set out also, but in a less stylish
manner. He paid five cents for a ride in the horse cars,
getting out in a locality very far from fashionable. He
stopped before a shabby, three-story house, and ringing the
bell, inquired for Mrs. Lucas.</p>

<p>"Third floor, front, right-hand side," was the direction.</p>

<p>The staircase was as shabby as the exterior of the house.
Philip soon stood on the third landing, and after a little
pause, knocked at the door. It was opened by a pale, sickly-looking
woman, who looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Is this Mrs. Lucas?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said she inquiringly.</p>

<p>"My name is Marden. You made me some shirts lately."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I hope they fitted."</p>

<p>"Excellently."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it. Perhaps he has some more work for
me!" thought the poor woman.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you find it hard work to get along in these
days of high prices," said Philip, surveying the scantily
furnished apartment.</p>

<p>"I do, indeed, sir," said Mrs. Lucas, sighing. "Rent and
provisions are very high, and I can't always get work. I
have a little girl of ten&mdash;she is out just now&mdash;but she cannot
do much. I try to keep her at school, but I find it hard to
keep her in decent clothing. It was a great help to me, the
money I received for making your shirts."</p>

<p>"I shall have some more work soon," said Philip kindly.
"Meanwhile will you accept this note? I hope it will be
of service."</p>

<p>"Ten dollars!" exclaimed Mrs. Lucas in surprise. "You
have made a mistake, sir. Have you not?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, you don't know how much good it will do me,"
said the poor woman, her face lighted up with pleasure.
"Thank you many times for your great kindness."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome, Mrs. Lucas. It is New Year's
Day, you know&mdash;I wish you a Happy New Year."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, you have done much to make it so."</p>

<p>There was a warm glow at Philip's heart as he went out
into the street. His call had been a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Two or three blocks brought him to another tenement
house, more shabby and dilapidated than the one he had
left.</p>

<p>"I think it is No. 17, rear house," he said.</p>

<p>He passed through a narrow passage, and emerged into
a dark court about fifteen feet square, swarming with little
children, and inquired of the first one that attracted his
attention, "Does Mrs. Flaherty live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the little girl addressed, "she's my mother."</p>

<p>"Will you show me her room?"</p>

<p>Little Bridget Flaherty led the way upstairs, a little surprised
at the appearance of her mother's visitor, and opened
the door of a dirty room without a carpet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flaherty rose in surprise, recognizing her visitor.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Marden, shure," she said. "And how did you
find the way, sir?"</p>

<p>"I happened to remember the street and number, Mrs.
Flaherty."</p>

<p>"I hope there's nothing wrong about the clothes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; but I'm out making my New Year's calls."</p>

<p>"And it's an honor, indade, that you should call on me.
Sit down, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>And she cleared off a chair, wiping it with her apron to
insure cleanliness.</p>

<p>Philip chatted with her five minutes, inquiring about her
family and circumstances. As he rose to go he took out
ten dollars and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"Is it for me?" she asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Flaherty, a New Year's gift."</p>

<p>I should hardly venture to reproduce the grateful thanks
which were showered upon Philip by the enthusiastic recipient
of his gift, and how she invoked all the saints in
the calendar to shield him from harm and fill his path with
blessings.</p>

<p>Philip next went to a bookstore, and purchased a series of
juveniles illustrated with bright, attractive pictures, and
taking the horse cars again was landed near a quiet little
street of no pretensions as regards fashion. He ascended
the steps of a plain, wooden house of two stories, and rang
the bell. It was the house of a widow, who made a scanty
living by keeping boarders of an humble class. She had
one boy of twelve, bright and athirst for knowledge, but
an invalid, and not strong enough to go to school. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
was nothing the lad loved like reading, but his mother could
not afford to buy him books, and her friends were not many
of them book owners. So he used to lie day after day on
the old lounge, finding the hours weary and monotonous.</p>

<p>It was his mother who opened the door.</p>

<p>"Jimmy will be so glad to see you, Mr. Marden," she
said. "You'll find him on the sofa, as usual."</p>

<p>"Does he get no better?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can see. Poor boy, he finds the time pass very
heavily."</p>

<p>"I've brought him some books that will while away the
hours."</p>

<p>"How kind you are! He will be beside himself with
joy."</p>

<p>She led the way into a small room, with a faded carpet
on the floor. A young boy with a merry look on his pale
face lay on a lounge. He lifted his eyes, and they brightened
as they met the gaze of the visitor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Marden, I'm so glad to see you!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And I am glad to see you, Jimmy&mdash;a Happy New Year
to you!"</p>

<p>"And you also, Mr. Marden."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jimmy. Now, what do you think I have
got in this big bundle?"</p>

<p>"Is it books?" asked the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jimmy, you have guessed right. Six new books,
and all for you."</p>

<p>"All for me. Oh, how kind you are! Do open them
quick."</p>

<p>Smiling at the boy's impatience, Philip cut the string
with his penknife, and displayed six handsomely bound volumes,
over which Jimmy was soon poring with delight.</p>

<p>"Then you like them, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so much. There was nothing which I should have
liked as well. What a good man you are, Mr. Marden. I
don't deserve it."</p>

<p>"I like to make people happy, Jimmy, that is all."</p>

<p>"And you have made me very happy, sir," said the boy,
his face lighting up with gratitude. "My life has been so
dull sometimes."</p>

<p>"Let us hope it will be brighter in future."</p>

<p>"I think it will, Mr. Marden, thanks to you."</p>

<p>Philip called at three other places, where he dispensed
timely and welcome gifts. We need not follow him. It is
enough to say that each visit carried sunshine with it and
left happiness behind it. When the last call had been made
he found that he had expended just fifty dollars, but he
felt richer without it.</p>

<p>The next morning the two young men met at their place
of business, for both were employed in the same mercantile
establishment. Tom Chester was heavy-eyed, and looked as
if he had been up all night. Philip's eye was bright, and
his nerves were as steady as usual.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good time, Tom?" asked Philip.</p>

<p>"Capital! I made all my calls, and had a jolly supper&mdash;to
top off with. Didn't get into bed till four this morning.
I feel rather seedy to-day, that's a fact. But New Year's
Day only comes once a year."</p>

<p>"True; how much did it cost you?"</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars. I suppose you, like a prudent boy, saved
your money?"</p>

<p>"There you are mistaken. I spent fifty dollars, also."</p>

<p>"You did!" exclaimed his friend in astonishment. "How
was that?"</p>

<p>"In making people happy."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>Philip gave a brief outline of what he had done.</p>

<p>"You're a strange fellow," said Tom Chester. "Who'd
ever have thought of spending New Year's Day in that
way?"</p>

<p>"A great many, I hope. Depend upon it. Tom, the best
way to secure happiness yourself is to promote the happiness
of others. I wouldn't exchange my investment for yours."</p>

<p>Dear reader, I have sketched two ways of spending the
day that ushers in the New Year. Tom Chester spent his
time and money in selfish gratification. Philip devoted his
to nobler uses. Which do you prefer?</p>

<h2><a name="PERILOUS_OCCUPATIONS" id="PERILOUS_OCCUPATIONS">PERILOUS OCCUPATIONS.</a></h2>


<p>Sealskins are a costly commodity, in more ways than one.
More perilous than almost any other mentionable pursuit,
seal-hunting is yearly exacting a greater penalty in human
lives than it ever did before. Hunted for generations, the
seals have become more wary, and year by year they retire
farther and farther into the well-nigh inaccessible ice of the
highest northern latitudes.</p>

<p>It is not sport, this hunting the seal from the icy, storm-swept
coast of Newfoundland; it is toil, whereby in part the
hardy Newfoundlander wins his scanty measure of bread,
and the chase is beset with multitudinous and unforeseen
perils.</p>

<p>The wind gathers the ice into floes, and jams it against
the coast, an immeasurable, jagged expanse of it, interspersed
with plains; then the Newfoundlander takes his gaff
and his food and his goggles, and sets out from his little
harbor, starting at midnight that he may come up with the
pack at dawn. But the wind which sweeps in the ice inevitably
sweeps it out again, without warning, in an hour,
or a day, or a week; nor does it pause to consider the situation
of the men who are twenty miles offshore. It veers
and freshens, and drives the whole mass, grinding and heaving,
far out to sea, where it disperses it into its separate
fragments.</p>

<p>The lives of the hunters depend upon the watchfulness
of the attenuated line of lookouts, from the women on the
headland to the first sentinel within signaling distance. But
tragedies occur notwithstanding. Some years ago of five
sealing-schooners that penetrated the drift ice then blocking
the northernmost extremity of Baffin's Bay one only returned.
Two or three years previously, at Kedy, near Cape
Voronoff, Siberia, three hundred Russian sealers, at work
upon an ice-floe, were driven northward into the frozen
ocean, owing to the sudden springing up of a southerly gale,
and were never heard of again.</p>

<p>At St. Paul's Island, one of the Pribyloff group, off the
coast of Alaska, are the graves of seventy odd sealers, found
frozen stiff and stark on an ice-floe that drifted ashore one
night.</p>

<p>As with sealskins, so with pearls. The pearl-diver's occupation
is among the most dangerous known. Generally
either an Arab or a full-blooded negro, he is invariably a
man of splendid physique and indomitable courage. Long
practise has enabled him to remain under water for two
minutes at a time without apparent inconvenience. Nevertheless,
the life of a professional pearl-diver is not considered
by experts to be worth more than six or seven years' purchase.</p>

<p>Many succumb every season to a strange and deadly form
of paralysis. Many more are eaten by sharks, drowned
through getting their feet entangled in weeds, caught in
crevices in the rocks while exploring the depths of the
sea, or seized and devoured quickly by shoals of gigantic
octopi&mdash;those ghouls of the ocean&mdash;which invariably infest
the fishing-grounds.</p>

<p>It is estimated that of the hundreds of egret-hunters who
each year set out for the heronries of Yucatan, a full ten
per cent. never return. Deep in the deadly, fever-laden recesses
of the forest swamps of the hinterland these beautiful
birds breed. The hunter pursues them remorselessly, his
life in his hand, for the snow-white tail-feathers are worth
from five to eight guineas.</p>

<p>The climate is deadly. The atmosphere is saturated with
miasma and infected with myriads of poisonous insects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Alligators lurk, too, in the black slime of the tortuous
bayous, which constitute the only means of inter-communication.
An egret-hunter who runs short of ammunition or
quinin simply lies down in the bottom of his canoe and
waits for death. Usually he has not long to wait. On the
average, for every half-dozen aigrettes&mdash;one may see hundreds
being worn any afternoon in Bond Street&mdash;a man's
life has been sacrificed.</p>

<p>Hardly less perilous, if any, is the orchid-hunter's profession.
Orchids love warmth and moisture, and warmth and
moisture in tropical countries are synonymous with miasma
and fever. Wild animals also and poisonous serpents abound
in the umbrageous depths wherein the rarer varieties lie
hidden. Not infrequently, too, the collector has to seek his
specimens among savages or semicivilized peoples, who
strongly resent his intrusion into their midst.</p>

<p>One firm of orchid-importers reported a year or two ago
that they had had five collectors killed in as many months
by the wild tribesmen of the Western Himalayan slopes;
while other three, even more unfortunate, were made
prisoners and carried off to undergo the nameless horrors
which have from time immemorial been characteristic of
Central Asian slavery.</p>

<p>Rubber is purchased at a terrible price. The mortality in
the State of Amazonias, in Brazil, corresponds with almost
diabolical exactness to the number of tons of rubber produced.
In fact, it is said each ton costs a human life, and
although there are no such horribly fiendish atrocities in
Brazil as has been charged against the Congo, it is nevertheless
true that the laborers who are brought into the rubber-fields
do not average more than three years of life; and
are, if not in law, at least in fact, subjected to hardships
never known or endured by the slaves in the United States,
or even by the slaves in the coffee countries of Brazil.</p>

<p>Of nearly seven million pounds of camphor obtained annually,
Formosa produces all but about six hundred thousand
pounds, but very few people have the faintest conception
of the dangers to which Japanese camphor collectors
are exposed in the Formosa hills when gathering this product.
Up to the present, in fact, the Japanese have found
it impossible to control the head-hunting savages of the
hills, and the development of this valuable industry depends
equally upon the success of their measures for encountering
and suppressing these determined and as yet unconquered
tribes.</p>

<p>Formosa, which is shaped somewhat like a huge sole,
has a rugged, mountainous back-bone, in which Mount Morrison
towers into the clouds to a height of twelve thousand
feet. Throughout the wild penetralia of these mountains
lurk a number of warlike tribes of varying strength, whose
lives are devoted to hunting, fishing, and fighting with one
another, their one community of interest being a passionate
ardor in the collection of human heads, whether of their
tribal enemies or of the Chinese coolies who live on the
verge of the hills or are engaged in the camphor industry.</p>

<p>The tree from which camphor is obtained is a species of
laurel indigenous to Formosa, and it is on the mountains
overrun by these terrible hordes of head-hunters that the
extensive forests from which practically the world draws its
supply of camphor are found.</p>

<h2><a name="POI_THEIR_STAFF_OF_LIFE" id="POI_THEIR_STAFF_OF_LIFE">POI THEIR STAFF OF LIFE.</a></h2>


<p>What bread is to the American or European poi is to
the native Hawaiian. No meal is complete without it, and
for the great majority of the natives it forms the principal
article of diet.</p>

<p>Poi is made from a tuberous root about the size of a
large sweet potato. It is first baked and afterward pounded
up with water until a smooth paste is obtained, much resembling
a wheat flour paste, except that the color is a pale
pink or purple.</p>

<p>This paste is allowed to ferment slightly and is then ready
for use. Formerly each family prepared its own poi, the
work being done by the men, as in fact were most other
cooking operations. Poi factories, in which machinery grinds
and mixes the material, have largely supplanted the old
method.</p>

<p>Many of the white residents of the islands eat poi to almost
the extent of the natives, but the taste is largely acquired
and strangers seldom care for it. Poi has a high
food value, and since it formed the principal food of the
old Hawaiians some persons credit it with the splendid
physical development of the race.</p>

<p>Poi was always eaten from wooden bowls or calabashes
and was conveyed to the mouth by the fingers, one, two
or three being employed according to the consistency of
the food, which fact establishes a designation of one, two or
three finger poi. White poi eaters now usually employ a
fork or spoon in lieu of fingers, although it is still common
even in the highest families to give native dinners or
"luaus" at which knives and forks are taboo and fingers
only used.</p>

<p>There is as much etiquette among the Hawaiians in eating
with the fingers as with modern table implements, and
the graceful motion by which a portion of poi is twisted
up on the fingers and transferred to the mouth would not
shock the sensibilities of the most refined. An invitation to
a real luau at which poi, baked pig, fish baked in leaves and
cocoanut in various forms were the chief features of the
menu is an experience which every visitor to Hawaii sincerely
covets.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="A_CITY_BEGUN_ON_A_RAFT" id="A_CITY_BEGUN_ON_A_RAFT">A CITY BEGUN ON A RAFT.</a></h2>


<p>The story of the founding of the City of Mexico is one
of the most extraordinary tales in history. It happened in
1325, at least, it began a long time before that, but was an
accomplished fact about 600 years ago.</p>

<p>In the first place, imagine an almost inaccessible mountain,
crowned with a valley at the height of 8,000 feet above the
level of the sea. In the centre of this valley was an immense
lake. When the Aztecs arrived, led by the priests
of the God of War, they found it in the possession of hostile
tribes.</p>

<p>For that reason, and because the priests declared that in
a certain part of the lake where there stood an elevation of
stones an eagle had been seen devouring a serpent, they
began the construction of the city on this spot, immediately
over the deepest waters of the lake. There had long existed
a prophecy among the Aztecs that their wanderings
would end when they should have reached a place where
the priests would behold an eagle resting on a cactus plant,
devouring a serpent.</p>

<p>Confident that they had found the spot ordained to be
their abiding home, they began to construct rafts of the
trunks of trees, covering them with thick layers of earth,
upon which they built rude huts of more or less solidity.
Groups of dwellings soon began to form themselves in
regular order, thus determining the primitive streets of the
new city.</p>

<p>They also constructed boats and oars of different sizes
useful in peace and war, and while certain of their number
occupied themselves in defending their homes and brethren
from the onslaughts of hostile tribes, others continued to
improve and enlarge the new city. Gradually the lake was
filled up, and terraces arose, one after another, in the place
once occupied by the deep waters.</p>

<p>This was in itself a herculean labor, unsurpassed in ingenuity
and durability by any similar work of ancient or
modern times. Upon the first of these terraces was constructed
the Teocalli, or sacrificial temple. It was begun in
1216 and not completed until 1325, a period of 109 years,
from which time may be dated the official foundation of
Tenochtitlan, to-day the modern City of Mexico.</p>

<p>Every boy who reads one of the splendid adventures of Motor
Matt, which are making their appearance in this weekly, is at once
surprised and delighted. Surprised at the generous quantity of
reading matter that we are giving for five cents; delighted with the
fascinating interest of the stories, second only to those published
in the Tip Top Weekly.</p>

<p>Matt has positive mechanical genius, and while his adventures
are unusual, they are, however, drawn so true to life that the reader can
clearly see how it is possible for the ordinary boy to experience them.</p>
